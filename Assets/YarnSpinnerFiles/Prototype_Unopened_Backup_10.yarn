The air is frigid, and the darkness seems to press down on you like a weight. The only sound is the faint, eerie laughter of distant crows above. Your fingers scrape against the cold, gritty ground as you grope for any sense of your surroundings. The texture is coarse, unsettling, like sandpaper under your skin. Your head feels submerged in fog—heavy, slow, like you're trapped in a half-forgotten dream.
Your eyes refuse to obey you, remaining shut as if something inside you resists waking up to the reality that surrounds you. A creeping fear slithers up your spine. Something is wrong. You need to act.
-> Give up.
    You consider trying harder, but the weight of exhaustion and the oppressive cold presses against your will. The thought of fighting back with the little strenght you have is unbearable.
    Your strength fades slowly, and the cold wraps tighter around you, drawing you into an endless, frozen void.

    You muster the last shreds of your will, forcing yourself to stay conscious. With immense effort, you pry your eyes open, just a sliver.

    -> Give in.
        Despite your efforts, exhaustion pulls you back. The cold whispers, offering relief if you only surrender. You can't resist it any longer.

     -> Try harder.
        With a surge of willpower, your eyes snap open. The world before you is bleak and an alien-like desert, but not one of sand. The ground looks like it has been drenched in ink, leaving everything cold and hollow. A biting wind brushes against your skin, sending shivers down your spine.
        <<set $AmountDetermination = $AmountDetermination +1>>
        The sudden sound of crows cawing fills the silence, their cries echoing eerily in the desolation. They circle overhead, as if they have been waiting for this moment.
        -> Try to shoo the crows away.
            You wave your arms, your voice weak and hoarse as you try to scatter the crows. But they don't flee. Instead, their cries intensify, faster and louder. 
            Then, without warning, they dive toward you like arrows, sharp beaks and claws tearing at your skin.
            Within moments, there's nothing left of you but the cold, endless dark.

            You stagger forward, your legs heavy, your vision still a blur. 
            You have no idea where you are, and every step feels like you're walking further into the unknown.

 A strange shape emerges from the gloom. It looks like a tree, but its branches twist and writhe like something out of a nightmare. Its bark is black and jagged, sharp edges jutting out like knives.
    ->Touch the tree.
        Against your better judgment, you reach out. 
        The instant your fingers brush the bark, a sharp pain cuts through you. Blood seeps from a deep gash in your hand. You curse under your breath and pull away.
        Should've known better, you think.

            ->Pick it up.
                Carefully, you reach into the hollow. Your fingers close around a cold, metallic object — a key.

title: Crow

The tree looms before you, its twisted branches like skeletal arms, casting jagged shadows that seem to reach for you. The air is thick and still, except for the faint rustle of feathers above. Suddenly, a crow swoops down from the circling flock, landing on one of the jagged branches. Its beady eyes lock onto you, filled with something unnerving—almost intelligent.
->Say something.
    You: "What are you looking at?"
    <<set $AmountCommunication = $AmountCommunication +1>>
    The crow's head tilts ever so slightly, its gaze narrowing, as though it sees through you—sees something inside you. Then, it opens its beak, and to your shock, a raspy voice escapes.    
    Crow: "What do you think you are looking at?"
    A chill seeps into your bones. The sound of its voice claws at the edges of your mind, scratching at something primal, something you're afraid to understand.
    Your thoughts spin. Did that crow just... speak?    
    ->Say Something.
        You: "What did you just say? Did you... talk?"
        <<set $AmountCommunication = $AmountCommunication +1>>
        The crow remains still, its black eyes never leaving yours. The silence presses down on you, thick and suffocating, as though the world itself is waiting for something.
        It hops to the side, tilting its entire body to examine you, as though appraising your worth. The longer the silence lingers, the more you begin to doubt your senses. Did it really speak? Or is the oppressive darkness warping your mind?
        Your heart pounds in your chest, a dull, steady beat that echoes through the silence like a distant drum.
        Crow: "Would you look at that, it is you!"
        <<declare $wasRecognized = true>>
        Nevermind, it is talking.
        The words hit you like a blow, rattling something deep within. The world feels just a little less real. You are recognized — but by what? And for what purpose?
        Your mind races. Is this a dream? A nightmare? Or worse—reality
        You glance back at the crow, its eyes never wavering. Perhaps it knows something you don't, something terrible lurking just out of sight.
        You sigh. There is no escape from this place, is there?
    ->Do nothing.
        You stand there, frozen in place, the weight of the moment pressing on you like a heavy, unseen force. The crows eyes remain locked on you, its beady gaze unnerving, almost accusatory.
        For a second, you feel as if the darkness itself is watching—waiting for you to falter.
->Do nothing.
    You stare at the crow with a blank expression. It watches you, unblinking, the tension between you thickening with each passing second.
Crow: "Time to break the ice, huh?"
That voice again. Cold and sharp, slicing through the silence.
Your mind reels. The world around you feels less tangible, as if at any moment it might unravel and reveal something far worse than darkness.
The crows voice drips with mocking amusement. Its presence feels more than just physical, as if it exists both in the real and somewhere far beyond, in the twisting shadows of your mind.
Crow: "What, Cat got your tongue?"
Its sly tone sends another shiver down your spine, and you realize you're trembling. There's something about this creature... something that feels wrong.
->Say something.
    You: "No."
    <<set $AmountCommunication = $AmountCommunication +1>>
    The word escapes your lips, barely audible, as if speaking might somehow give the darkness more power.
    Crow:"Are you sure? You look like you saw a ghost, even tho.. there usually dont roam around in this area."
    You: "What?"
    The crow cocks its head, and for the briefest moment, you swear its beak curls into a smirk.
    Crow: "Nothing!"
    It says it so casually, but there is something behind its words — something it is not telling you.
    Your thoughts spiral. Ghosts? A talking crow? What is this place? A thousand questions gnaw at you, but none of them seem to have answers.
    The silence stretches, oppressive and thick, leaving you with a sense that you're teetering on the edge of something dangerous.
->Say nothing.
    You remain silent, frozen in place like a statue. Your mind tries to process what is happening, but the weight of it all is too much. It is as if time itself has stopped, and you are trapped in this strange moment with the crows piercing gaze upon you.
<<if $AmountCommunication >2>>
    Crow: "You are one of the curious ones are you not? Always asking questions. Lucky for you, I know more than the others."
    It glances toward the circling flock above, dismissively.
    Crow: "They would not understand. They are... lesser."
<<elseif $AmountCommunication <2>>
    Crow: "Not much of a talker, are you? But... you still have questions, do you not?"
    Its eyes narrow, a glint of something sinister in their depths.
<<endif>>
The sudden screeching of the other crows pierces the air, sharp and grating like nails on a chalkboard. The sound digs into your skull, bringing with it a sudden headache, dull and throbbing. You wince, the pain making the world blur for just a moment before your eyes snap back to the crow in front of you.

Crow: "So, anything else you would you like to know?"
->What is this place.
    Crow: "This place? A place? This is no such place you speak of. This is the Void. Here everything lands that is nothing or no more, drifts."
    A weird feeling takes place in your chest at the mention of "nothing." The Void. The word settles in your mind, heavy like a weight, stirring an unease that makes your skin crawl.
    <<set $AmountKnowledge = $AmountKnowledge +1>>
    <<jump Crow2>>
->You.
    Crow: "Me? Hahahaha!"
    The sound erupts from the crow, a shrill, unnatural screech that cuts through the air. It's more than just laughter — it is as if the sound itself is mocking you. It echoes in your ears, growing louder until it vibrates in your skull. You flinch as the sound dies down.
    Crow: "That's hilarious!" it sneers, its beady eyes locked onto yours, enjoying the discomfort you must be feeling.
    The ringing in your ears lingers, even as the crow settles back into eerie silence.
    Crow: "But really, what do you want to know?
    -> Who are you?
        <<set $AmountCuriousity = $AmountCuriousity +1>>
        Crow: "Who am I? Intresting question."
        The crow's feathers ruffle, its tone shifting as if it enjoys the power it holds over you.
        Crow: "Well, I do not know either. Im just a crow."
        Its words trail off, leaving a gnawing emptiness. The lack of answers makes your stomach churn as if you have just touched something dark and cold inside yourself.
        <<jump Crow2>>
    -> What are you?
        <<set $AmountCuriousity = $AmountCuriousity +1>>
        Crow: "Just a curious crow," it responds, the words dripping with a sly undertone that feels almost predatory.
        The answer is far from satisfying. There is something more behind those eyes, something it is choosing to keep hidden.
        <<set $AmountCrowsFavour = $AmountCrowsFavour +1>>
        <<jump Crow2>>
->Me.
    <<if $wasRecognized is true>>
        Crow: "Oh? So your curious about yourself?"
        There is something unnerving in how it speaks the word "yourself," as though it knows something you do not. Its gaze sharpens, scanning you like prey.
        Crow: "Well then..."
        It pauses, the moment stretching thin, until even the crows above seem to fall silent, waiting.
        Crow: "I suppose it would not be harmful to give you a slight hint."
        A hint? You feel your pulse quicken. Your thoughts race, grasping for something solid in the flood of confusion.
        Crow: "Listen closely! You curious one."
        The crow makes a guttural noise, clearing its throat.
        Crow: "They speak of your deeds with awe and reverence, but their words are hollow, a cruel pretense. Their eyes hold a sadness, a longing unseen, for the one they remember, the one who has been."
        Each word hangs in the air, pressing down on you like a weight. A feeling of dread swells in your chest, tightening around your heart.
        <<set $AmountKnowledge = $AmountKnowledge +1>>
        Crow: "Thatis all I can give you. You will have to figure out the rest."
        A riddle. Great. Just what you needed. You grind your teeth, frustration rising, but behind it is something more — fear, uncertainty. The crows words have left a bitter taste in your mouth.
        <<jump Crow2>>
    <<elseif $wasRecognized is false>>
        The crow shifts, its feathers ruffling as it eyes you with cold detachment.
        Crow: "What do you mean? You are you. A human, that is all there is."
        The words cut deep, a sharp pang shoots through your chest like a knife. The simplicity of it is terrifying. Is that really all you are? Just a human? No purpose, no meaning? A shadow of doubt creeps in, cold and unforgiving, squeezing your heart.
        But you fight to hold on, to keep hope alive in this strange, forsaken place. You have to.

    A twisted tree, a talking crow—how could things get any stranger? Your mind spins, struggling to keep up with the madness of it all. You feel a knot of confusion tightening in your chest, almost suffocating.
    Crow: "Curious one, you should keep going. Do not stand there being weird — move along." it scolds, flapping its wings at you impatiently.
    You shiver as a gust of wind howls through the void, cold enough to bite into your skin, pushing you forward like an unseen hand.
    The endless black stretches ahead of you, until something finally appears in the distance—a white shape standing stark against the darkness. You hurry towards it, your legs trembling from exhaustion, but the sight of it fuels your desperate need for answers.
    It is a door. A simple, white door in the middle of nowhere. The sight makes your stomach churn with unease. This whole place feels like one big, cruel joke.
    You run your hands over its wooden surface, rough under layers of thick paint. It feels... real, unlike the rest of this nightmarish place. The handle is cold, its matte surface unremarkable, yet your heart beats faster as you reach for it.

        Wait. The key. You remember the key you found inside that strange, gnarled tree.

            The familiar, mocking voice sends a shiver down your spine. You look up, and there it is, perched smugly on top of the door frame.
            Crow: "Having trouble with this door?"
            The crow's voice cuts through your thoughts, sharp and mocking. it is perching arrogantly on the doorframe, its beady eyes gleaming with mischief.
            Crow: "Oh, do not look so sour. It is just a door."
            The crow cackles, a sound that grates at your nerves. It fluffs its feathers and peers at you, head cocked to the side.
            You grit your teeth, eyes narrowing as you glare at the feathery figure above. Your silence only seems to egg the crow on.

            You huff, crossing your arms in defiance, refusing to give it the satisfaction of a response.
            Crow: "Ahh, do not be like that!" 
            It flaps its wings once, settling in closer. 
            Crow: "I will give you a hint, since you seem a bit... lost."
            You tilt your head, a small twitch in your brow indicating your annoyance, but you remain still, waiting.
            Crow: "The key", it says with a mocking tone, drawing the words out slowly. 
            Crow: "You already saw it, but you were too busy...dreaming."
            Your eyes widen. The tree? That must be what it is referring to.
            Crow: "There you go!" The crow cackles. 
            Crow: "Finally catching on, are we?"
            A low, frustrated exhale escapes your lips as you realize the crow is right. The key must have been there all along.
            Crow: "Off you go then!" it croaks, flapping its wings dismissively.
            Crow: "Back to the tree. Do not dawdle now, would not want you getting stuck here forever."
            You pause for a moment, anger simmering beneath your skin, but you turn and start walking, leaving the crow's mocking laughter behind.

The crows words echo in your mind, each syllable sharp like a knife, cutting into the quiet of the cold, endless black void.
A key… back in the tree. How could you have missed it? You squeeze your eyes shut, clenching your fists. How far was the tree even? The ground beneath your feet feels frozen, the cold biting into your skin, leaving you numb. You glance ahead — darkness stretches in every direction, and a bitter wind slices through the air.
Was it even worth going back? It is freezing. You could freeze to death out here. Maybe… maybe that would not be so bad.
But… you have not died yet, right? Not after all this time. Though... how long has it been? You glance at your hands — numb, trembling — and flex your fingers, barely feeling them.
Has it been hours? Days? Weeks?
What day is it?
You stop in your tracks, suddenly unsure if you even remember what days feel like. Did the sun ever set here? Was there ever a sun? Your breath hitches, cold air stabbing your lungs.
You could turn around right now, go back to the tree, or maybe… you could just lie down right here. Let the cold take you. Maybe it's better this way...
<<if $AmountKnowledge > 1>>
    But then… the Void. The word flits into your mind, tugging at a memory, something familiar. The crow had said that before — The Void. Everything that was nothing, or no more.
    Your heart steadies, beating slow but deliberate. This is not just a vast, empty wasteland, is it? No, there is more here. There has to be.
    The Void... there's something deeper about this place. Something you're missing. You draw a shaky breath, letting the thought fill you. There's still more to find. You can not stop here — not yet.
    You shake the lingering doubt from your mind, feeling a small surge of confidence. Maybe you will find answers back at the tree. Maybe the crow knows more than it is letting on.
    Just keep moving. The cold bites, but you can keep moving. You have to.
<<elseif $AmountKnowledge < 1>>
    But... what if there is not anything out here? What if you are walking in circles, lost in this endless wasteland with no end? Your footsteps slow, your eyes flickering to the void around you, feeling it close in.
    What if you are the only one here?
    The tree. The key. What does it matter? It is just a pointless chase for something that might not even exist. You missed it the first time, who is to say it was ever there? The crows words feel like a mockery — just another twisted game.
    Your breath becomes shallow, panic curling into your chest like the cold.
    What if this place... never ends? What if you have been walking for eternity already? You can not remember when it started. You can not remember when it ends.
    What are you doing here? Why even try? Maybe… you are not even real anymore.

Lost in your thoughts, you do not even notice the shadow overhead until you hear a familiar caw.
Crow: "Lost again?"
Its voice snaps you out of your spiral, and you jerk your head upward, seeing the crow lazily circling above you. It swoops low, flying ahead of you, and you follow its path with your eyes, feeling the weight of its mocking gaze.
Crow: "You always seem to be wandering. This way, this way!"
It flaps its wings impatiently, taunting. 
Crow: "What, getting tired? Do not tell me you are giving up already?"
You grit your teeth, your jaw locking as you suppress the rising frustration. The crow dips lower, flying just ahead of you, teasing you as it weaves back and forth in the air.
Crow: "Come on, follow me! I know where you're going... Do you?"
Despite the biting cold and the nagging voice in your head urging you to stop, your legs start moving again, step by step.
Crow: "Hurry up! Can not keep me waiting forever!"
The crow dips low, swooping toward an unkown direction. 
You trudge forward, the crows jeering voice pushing you onward and when you finally reach the twisted, gnarled branches of the tree, the crow lands on the very same spot it did before, watching you intently as this time you pull out the key of the hollow trunk of the tree without hesitation.
<<set $HasKey = true>>
Crow: "Aww, good job!" the crow sneers, its mocking tone dripping with sarcasm as it taunts you for not finding the key earlier.

As the key turns in the lock and the door clicks open, the weight of your anxiety lifts, snapping you out of the trance of dread over what might await you on the other side.
You shift your trembling hands from the key onto the handle of the door and press iot down slow and soft. Slowly you pull the door open and - caw caw, suddenly the craw lands on the doorframe so swiftly like an arrow that was shot.
Crow: “Are you sure you want to do this?” It says in a sarcastic tone, its beady eyes glinting with mischief.
You hesitate, your breath hitching in your throat.
Crow: “I mean, what is on the other side? Could be more of this lovely void. Or worse — what if it is filled with horrors waiting just for you? Is it not cozy here?”
You swallow hard, your resolve wavering.
Crow: “And hey, think about it. You have already walked so far. What if you open this door and it is just... empty? Or worse, a trap?”
The crow hops closer, its gaze unwavering.
Crow: “You could just turn back, you know. Stay in the safety of the unknown, where at least nothing can hurt you. Or go ahead and throw yourself into the chaos. But do you really think you are ready for whatever's behind that door?”
Each word pierces deeper, planting seeds of doubt in your mind. You glance back at the door, then at the void stretching endlessly behind you.
Crow: “So, what is it going to be? Courage or folly? Choice or chance?”
Its taunting voice hangs in the air, forcing you to confront the weight of your decision.

    You take a step back, your hand lingering on the handle. The crow watches, its head cocked to the side, as if waiting for your next move.
    Crow: “Ah, staying put, are we? Smart choice, really. Safety in the familiar, even if it is just the void.”
    You nod slightly, though a pang of regret twists in your gut.
    Crow: “That is right. Why risk it when you can bask in the comfort of uncertainty? After all, is not nothing better than the unknown?”
    The crow spreads its wings, flapping gently as it hovers just above your head.
    Crow: “You might as well make yourself at home here. Just you, me, and the emptiness. No dangers lurking behind doors. No surprises. Just endless silence.”
    A chill sweeps through the air, and you shiver involuntarily. The shadows around you seem to pulse with life, whispering secrets you can not quite grasp.
    Crow: “See? You are already starting to feel it — the allure of stagnation. Embrace it! Why move forward when you can linger here, half-alive? It is cozy, is it not?”
    You feel the weight of the crow's words wrapping around you like a heavy cloak, suffocating any spark of motivation.
    A resigned sigh escapes your lips as you slowly release the doorknob, stepping back into the cold embrace of the void.
    The crow flaps its wings above you, casting a fleeting shadow across your face.
    Crow: “Ah, surrendering already? How comforting! You and I, just being here in the nothingness. Does it not feel nice?”
    You nod, though the gesture feels empty, echoing the hollowness that now fills your chest. With each passing moment, time stretches before you, an endless expanse of gray, as if the void itself is pulling you deeper into its grasp.
    Crow: “What do you think might have been behind that door? A treasure? A glimmer of hope? Or maybe just more questions? It is delightful to ponder, is it not?”
    You glance back at the door in the distance, a specter of what could have been. The possibilities swirl in your mind, tantalizing yet distant, like whispers in the wind.
    Crow: “But here we are! Together in our little world, where nothing can touch you. No fear of failure, no risk of discovery. Just sweet, sweet mediocrity.”
    You wander aimlessly, feeling like a ghost drifting through the shadows. The emptiness wraps around you like a shroud, the cold air brushing against your skin, numbing your thoughts and dulling your senses.
    Crow: “Is this not what you wanted? To escape the unknown? To remain safe in the silence? And yet, I see the flicker of doubt in your eyes. You are half-alive, my friend. A mere shell of what you could be.”
    The crow circles above you, a persistent reminder of the choice you have made. Its beady eyes glimmer with mischief, and you can not help but wonder if it finds amusement in your stagnation.
    Crow: “You will wander here for eternity, you know. Half-alive, forever pondering what lies behind that door. What might have awaited you. But it is too late now, is it not?”
    You keep walking, each step a testament to your surrender. The shadows dance around, continuesly whispering secrets that you will never uncover, while the crow hovers above, a harbinger of your resignation.
    Crow: “What a curious fate you have chosen. Just think of all the adventures you will miss, the stories left untold. Yet here you are, trapped in your own mind, tethered to the void.”
    With every moment that passes, the weight of your indecision settles deeper into your bones, and you find yourself questioning if the choice to stay was ever truly yours. The door remains ajar in your thoughts, a haunting reminder of the life that could have been, while the crows mocking laughter echoes through the emptiness, leaving you to wander the abyss, forever caught between choices unmade.

The floor feels unnaturally smooth, like polished marble, yet there's a strange warmth to it, not like the cold and gritty texture from before. No source of light is visible, and the fog ahead seems alive, swirling at the edges of your vision but never closer.
<<if $AmountInvestigation >= 1>>
    Your eyes dart around, scanning the horizon—or what you think is the horizon. There are no walls, no landmarks. Just the floor stretching endlessly and the fog, swirling as though it is hiding something. The light here doesn't cast shadows. Everything feels suspended in time, except for the fog.
<<elseif $AmountInvestigation < 1>> 
    You pause to take in your surroundings, a sense of disorientation washing over you.
    Your heart races, and your breathing becomes shallow. This place... it shouldn't exist. There's nothing—no walls, no horizon, just endless white. It feels as if you're standing in the middle of nothing, and it takes every ounce of will to fight off the creeping panic. Your head spins, your hands tremble. Is this really better than what was behind the door?

Out of nowhere, a familiar voice cuts through your thoughts. The crow's shrill laughter echoes from behind.
Crow: "Took you long enough to make the leap! I was beginning to wonder if you would stay on that side forever." The crow's voice is laced with sarcasm as it perches on your shoulder with an air of smugness.
<<if $AmountCrowsFavour >=1>>
    You catch a glint in its eyes—a smirk, almost. You know it's amused by your struggle, but there's also a spark of something else: curiosity.
    It catches your gaze and lets out a mocking laugh.
<<else>>
    You glance at the crow, uncertain of its intent. It cocks its head, as if mocking you for even bothering to look at it. 
<<endif>>
Crow: "What, surprised? Don't stare at me like that."
You frown, trying to hide your unease. Despite the sarcasm, you feel strangely grateful for the crow's presence—at least you're not alone in this place.
The crow flaps its wings, repositioning itself on the doorframe.
Crow: "So, what now? What is the grand plan, hmm? You've come so far. Surely you must have some idea of what you're after?"
The question lingers in the air, making you think about everything you have done up to this point. What is the goal? Why are you here? Is there something you're supposed to find?
You reflect on the crows words. They feel sharp, almost cutting, like it is trying to force you into doubt. But at the same time, it feels like a push—urging you to keep moving.
Crow: "Need me to hold your hand now?" The crows tone sharpens. 
Crow: "Just keep moving. Or stand there. Your call."

	You feel compelled to ask something, anything to make sense of this place.
	You take a breath and look at the crow. Its mocking tone aside, you need answers.
	You squint at the Crow, mouth opening, but the words escape you. What can you ask that will make sense of all this? Still, you manage to say something…
	You: "Can I... can I ask you something?"
	It is a simple question, but in this endless expanse, it feels profound.
	Crow: "Ah, a question! Finally! What is it this time? Something deep and meaningful, or just another 'why me' sob story?"
	Its tone is sharp, amused. 
	It stares at you, mockingly pointing to the horizon, where fog still obscures anything tangible.

->Turn and Start Walking.
	You feel an odd pull in your gut. Despite the eerie stillness of the place, there is something that pushes you forward. Without saying a word, you turn and begin walking.
	Crow: "Ah, there it is." The Crow flutters ahead, almost lazily circling around you. 
	Crow: "Curiosity is a dangerous thing, you know." Its words trail off as it glides forward, the fog parting ever so slightly.
	Your steps are slow at first, but with every movement, a certain urgency builds inside you. The Crow continues to hover above, staying just ahead, as if leading you somewhere—or taunting you with the unknown.
	The fog thickens, but you keep walking, even though your legs feel heavy, almost as if they are sinking into the floor. A gnawing voice in the back of your mind asks if you made the right choice stepping through that door.

Then, out of the corner of your eye, something flickers. A shadow? A figure? You glance to your left, and there, just at the edge of your vision, you see the hazy outline of someone—a person, or perhaps several people, their forms distant and blurred.
You stop. Your heart skips a beat. For a moment, you think you hear a voice. No, not a voice, but multiple voices—faint, like whispers carried on a breeze. They sound… familiar.
You: “What…?”
You squint, straining to focus, but the figures remain shrouded in the fog, indistinct and unreachable. The voices fade just as quickly as they appeared, leaving you standing alone again in the emptiness. Were they real? Or just another illusion?
Crow: “Ah, so you saw them, did you not ?” The crows voice draws closer, more playful now. 
Crow: “People from your past. Friends, family. Figures you ca not quite remember… but they remember you. Funny how that works, is it not?”
You stay silent, but the flicker of hope that just sparked in your heart dims as uncertainty creeps back in. Were those people really there, or was it just your mind playing tricks on you again? You push the thoughts away, focusing on the path ahead. You can not afford to be distracted by false hope.
Crow: “You wil not get far like this, you know,” it teases. 
Crow: “Walking without a plan, without a purpose. You can wander for hours, days, years… and still, you will be exactly where you started.”
Your pulse quickens at the crow's words. Maybe looking deeper is what you need to do. Perhaps if you focus, you can understand this place better — or at least yourself- and find a way out.
->Reflect on your feelings
	You take a seat on the cool, smooth surface and let your thoughts flow freely. You acknowledge the despair clawing at your heart. What is it that you want? The question lingers, twisting in your mind. 
	The familiarity of this place gnaws at you, like a half-remembered dream. Each shadowy figure that flickers in the fog stirs echoes of forgotten feelings — fear, despair, and those small glimmers of hope that once led you to enter this door.
	Crow: "There it is! That flicker of something! You should keep that feeling close, you know. It might just light your way."	
	->Continue
		You close your eyes, allowing your mind to drift deeper. The fog thickens, swirling around you as a memory begins to emerge. You see yourself sitting on a bench in a dimly lit park. The air is crisp, and the scent of autumn leaves fills your lungs.
		A figure sits next to you. Though their face is blurred, nontheless you can make out some details: tall height, a oval faceshape and short brown hair. Their long green sweater and blue jeans billow gently in the breeze. You recall their laughter — warm and inviting, a sound that once felt like home. You feel a connection, an unspoken understanding, as if they could see into the depths of your soul.
		The memory feels so familiar and fond, a moment frozen in time. You remember laughing together, sharing secrets and dreams, the comfort of companionship wrapping around you like a blanket. Who are they? You ache to know, to grasp this fleeting memory that feels so vital, yet it dances just out of reach.
		But before you can capture more of it, the scene fades with a flash, time slipping through your fingers like sand. You blink, the world around you sharpening back into focus.
		The crow watches you with a mixture of intrigue and concern, its head tilted as it inches closer.
		Crow: "You look like you have seen a ghost" it says, its voice laced with a surprising gentleness.
		ou pause, noting the worried tone. For a moment, you wonder if there is more to this creature than just sarcasm. Maybe it has a soft core beneath the sharp remarks.
		Crow: "But seriously, just staring off into the distance like that? What is next, are you going to start drooling?"
		You grunt in annoyance, brushing off the crows jibe, but beneath your irritation, a flicker of amusement sparks.
		You take a deep breath and decide to share your experience.
		You: “I just… saw something. I was on a bench with someone. They felt so familiar, like the shadows in the fog, but clearer. I could not see their face, but I remember the way they laughed. It felt… important.”
		The crows eyes widen slightly, an unexpected seriousness settling over its features. 
		Crow: “Important, huh? Sounds like you have touched a nerve. Memories can be tricky. They like to play hide and seek, especially in a place like this.”
		You nod, a mix of hope and frustration swirling within you. 
		You: “But why can I not remember more? Why does it feel so close yet so far?”
		Crow: “Ah, that is the million-dollar question, is it not? But maybe what matters is not what you remember, but what you feel. Those memories are the keys to understanding this Plane. And maybe… understanding yourself.”
		The crow hops a little closer, its beady eyes glinting with something akin to determination.
		Crow: “You are on the right path, whether you know it or not. Just keep moving, and maybe the answers will come to you. Or maybe they will just flit away again. That is the fun part!”
		With the crows playful remark hanging in the air, you feel a shift within yourself. The memories, however elusive, seem to stir something deep inside — a resolve to keep searching, to find the pieces that complete your story, even as uncertainty continues to envelop you.
		<<set $AmountHope = $AmountHope +1>>
		You gather your strenght and stand back up and decide its time to continue walking to find a meaning to this place and an escape.
		<<jump VeilOfDesolation>>
	->Move on
		You take a deep breath, feeling the weight of your emotions settle into your chest like an unwelcome burden. The fleeting familiarity lingers in your mind, but you shake your head, deciding it is time to move forward.
		With a reluctant sigh, you push yourself off the cool surface, your feet finding their rhythm against the smooth, empty ground. The crow flutters slightly, watching you with a bemused expression.
		Crow: “What is the rush? Trying to outrun your thoughts? Good luck with that! They tend to follow you, you know.”
		Ignoring the crows quip, you continue walking, the silence of this place wrapping around you like a thick fog. Each step feels heavier than the last, the uncertainty of your path weighing on your mind. The emptiness stretches out before you, a void that seems to mock your every move.
		You ca not shake the feeling that something important was just within your grasp, that the answers you seek might still be hiding somewhere in this strange realm. Yet, the deeper you dig into your thoughts, the more tangled they become.
		As you walk, the fog swirls around your feet, sometimes revealing faint outlines of figures in the distance, reminiscent of the blurry faces you had seen earlier. You catch glimpses of laughter, whispers, and familiar warmth, but every time you try to focus, the images dissolve into the ether.
		Crow: “You really think walking aimlessly will help? You might as well stop and just let the fog swallow you whole!”
		Your frustration bubbles to the surface. 
	    You: “Maybe I am not trying to make sense of it all right now, alright? Maybe I just want to keep moving, to see where this leads.”

        You muster your courage and look the crow in the eye. 
        You: “What do you know about this place? Why are you even following me?”
        Crow: "Ah, questions again. I thought by now you would have realized that I am only here for the entertainment value."
	    You blink in shock, your seriousness contrasting with the crows flippant tone. 	
        You: “Seriously?!”
	    Crow: “Calm down! No need to ruffle your feathers. Maybe you should just keep walking and save the serious talk for later.”
	    With a sly glance, the crow gestures toward the bulk of fog not far from you, swirling and shifting as if alive. 
	    Crow: “Look at that! Do you not hear their voices?"
	    As you turn your attention, you see glimpses forming within the fog: a figure laughing joyfully, a tree bending gently in the wind, its leaves rustling softly. A warm feeling of comfort washes over you, but oddly, instead of happiness, a profound sadness envelops your heart.
	    You step forward, wanting to grasp the moment, but just as quickly as it appeared, the fog dissipates into thin air, leaving you speechless and somehow devastated without answers.
	    Crow: “Ah, I see that look! Do not worry; there are more of those little delights on our way. What else would be in this endless void, after all?” The crow chuckles, its humor a light attempt to ease your disappointment.
	    You nod slowly, still in a trance, overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions. The warm memory had felt comforting, yet the sadness clung to you, nagging at your thoughts. As you walk, you try to piece together why this bittersweet moment affected you so deeply, but the answers elude you.
	    You push through the weight of your emotions, hoping the next step might bring clarity—or at least another flicker of the past.
	    <<jump VeilOfDesolation>>
->Investigate the fog <<if $AmountInvestigation >=1>>
	You decide to step closer to the fog, straining to see if you can catch a glimpse of those shadowy figures again.
	The fog thickens around you, swirling in an almost playful manner. You reach out, your fingers grazing the cool, soft mist. Suddenly, you feel a tug at your memory, an echo of laughter, a fleeting image of someone you once knew — or thought you did.
	Crow: "See? There is something in there, is it not there? But you have to choose to follow it or let it fade away."
	<<set $AmountPerception = $AmountPerception +1 >>
    ->Follow it
        You take a deep breath and step even closer, stretching out your hand in an attempt to grasp the elusive shapes lurking within the fog. The moment your fingers make contact, the fog dissipates like a wisp of smoke, leaving you standing alone in the emptiness.
        A pang of disappointment stings your chest as you realize the shadowy figures and echoes of laughter have vanished.
        Crow: “Ah, what are you doing! You can not touch memorys, you can only feel them.”
        You shoot the crow a confused and frustrated look, struggling to comprehend its words.
        Crow: “What? Did you think you could just scoop them up like marbles? You are not a child anymore!” The crow cackles, clearly enjoying your perplexity. 
        Crow: “You can not physically feel a memory—only feel with your…” it pauses for dramatic effect.
        Crow: “Your heart!”
        A sigh escapes your lips as you ponder what the crow has just said. Memorys?. It does seem illogical to think you could touch memories surrounded by fog but... Well, maybe it is better to observe and listen instead. There has to be a way to find more of them to find out who these people are in your memorys and why you are here?
        You nod slightly, a hint of agreement surfacing in your thoughts. 
        Crow: “Exactly! Just do not expect them to play nice. Now, the best way to find more is to keep moving. Let us see what else this fog has in store!”

        You hesitate for a moment, watching as the fog swirls playfully around you. You decide to let the fleeting memories fade away, allowing the shadows to dissolve into the ether.
        Crow: “Wise choice! Sometimes it is best to leave things to their own devices.”
        As the last wisps of fog vanish, you feel a mix of relief and regret. The echoes of laughter and fleeting images drift away, leaving you feeling strangely hollow yet strangely liberated.
        Crow: “See? There was nothing in there but a mirage. You are better off without chasing ghosts!”
        You give the crow a skeptical glance. Wat if those memories could help you? What if they had meaning?
        Crow: “If your trying to find a meaning in this, with your staring contest against the ground, then I have to dissapoint you." The crow says cutting through your thoughts.
        Crow: "Meaning is subjective, my friend! Sometimes, the best way to find clarity is to let the fog clear up on its own.” The crow flaps its wings with a flourish, seeming to take delight in your internal struggle.
        Taking a moment to reflect, you realize that perhaps it is not worth dwelling on what you can not grasp. Instead, maybe it is time to discover what lies ahead.
        Crow: “Now, let us see what else we can uncover! Who knows? The next memory might be waiting just around the corner.”
        With a nod, you steel yourself and begin to walk again.

Determination is fueling your steps. As you traverse the Plane, you can feel a strange energy swirling around you. There is a shift in the air, as if the atmosphere itself is waiting for your next move.
Crow: “Now, that is more like it! Sometimes, moving on leads to surprises. Or maybe just more questions… but who does not love a little mystery?”
You glance back at the crow, feeling a mix of annoyance and gratitude. In this empty Plane, your gratful for having any kind of company and not being completely alone, all by yourself.
As you draw nearer to the shimmering glow, the air thickens around you. A sense of dread creeps in, tightening its grip on your chest like an iron band. The heartbeat of the light pulsates, resonating with your own, and with each beat, the anxiety rises.
Crow: “Wait! Are you sure you want to encounter this? It might be… more than you bargained for.”
His usual snark is absent, replaced by a rare note of concern. This sudden shift in tone sends a chill down your spine. The crow, who always seemed to thrive on chaos and dark humor, is now visibly anxious. You can see it in the way his feathers ruffle and how his beady eyes dart back and forth, as if searching for an escape.
Your heart races, and you halt in your tracks, a knot of apprehension twisting in your stomach. The sight of the crow's unease is unsettling, causing your own worries to spiral.

You look at the pulsating glow, its rhythm beckoning, almost daring you to step forward. But as the panic in your chest rises, your feet stay rooted. Something deep within warns you—some emotions are too overwhelming to face. You turn away, feeling the weight of that decision settling over you like a shroud.
The Crow watches you, silent at first, then lets out a low, resigned sigh.
Crow: “So, you are turning back, are you? Not everyone is ready to face… all of that. But you realize what this means, do you not?”
You do not answer. The ache in your chest feels heavier now, a hollow feeling where hope might have once been. The glow begins to dim behind you, and with it, the faint beat of something you can not quite name—like a part of yourself slipping away, drifting back into the endless void.
The crows voice softens, uncharacteristically tender.
Crow: “Well, no shame in walking away. Life is full of places best left untouched, right?” They pause, but there is something sad in their gaze. 
Crow: “Still, it is a shame. I thought maybe you would be the one to break free.”
You walk forward in silence, each step feeling heavier, as though invisible chains bind you to the ground. The landscape stretches endlessly, and for the first time, the emptiness feels more permanent, as if you are now bound to wander it forever.
You turn to the crow, hoping for some reassurance, but he only makes a gesture that seems like a shrug, his eyes darkened with something that looks almost like pity.
Crow: “Guess we keep moving… not that there is much left to see. Sometimes moving on just means… drifting. Until you forget what you came here for.”
Your chest tightens as the gravity of your choice settles in, a profound sadness taking root, echoing through the vast silence. With each passing moment, the shimmer that once beckoned fades completely, leaving nothing but the empty Plane of Illusion—a place of hollow echoes and fading memories.

Each step forward becomes a battle as you close in on the storm. Its center pulses like a heartbeat, casting a ghostly glow that leaks through the thickening fog. Voices and fragments of images flicker at the edges of the storm, echoes of your past playing like a thousand memories tangled in the haze. Gusts of wind lash at you, sharp and cold, as if daring you to turn back.
Crow: “Hey, are you really sure about this?” The crow swoops between you and the storm, unusually somber. 
Crow: “It looks like… a bit much, does it not?” The concern in its voice unsettles you; the crow, usually so confident, even mocking, seems shaken.
You take a breath, but each gust claws into your lungs, stirring forgotten, half-buried emotions. Anxiety creeps in like frost as you are reminded of the crows words: “Some storms are better left… avoided.” What if this storm consumes you? What if this is the end? Doubts coil around your thoughts, your decisions, making you question every step that brought you here.
<<if $AmountCrowsFavour >=1>>
    Through the haze, the crows silhouette flits ahead, fighting the pull of the wind, its voice rising above the storm. 
    Crow: “Do not stop now! You are almost there!” Its tone is more urgent than ever, but you feel a glimmer of reassurance. 
    Crow: “You have got this, do not let the past pull you under!”
<<elseif $AmountCrowsFavour <1>>
    You glance back and see the crow struggling against the wind, each gust pushing it further away. The emptiness grows, gnawing at you like the biting wind. For the first time, the absence of its sarcastic commentary leaves you feeling hollow—stranded, and alone.
<<endif>>
As you push forward, the heart of the storm looms closer, glowing brighter with each step. Shielding your eyes, you squint into the glare, but its light only intensifies, filling the world around you. A warmth touches your shoulder, gentle, comforting. You halt, breath caught in your throat, as a memory breaks through the fog.
You are sitting on a weathered bench in a dimly lit park. The air is crisp, tinged with the scent of autumn leaves as they crunch underfoot. Beside you sits a figure, their face blurred, yet something about them feels achingly familiar.
The wind tousles their short brown hair, framing an oval face, softened by shadows. They s
are dressed in a long green sweater and blue jeans, casual yet warm, as if they belong here beside you. Their laughter fills the air, warm and inviting—a sound that once felt like home.
A rush of images: secrets exchanged under fading lamplights, dreams shared in hushed tones, the comfort of unspoken understanding wrapping around you like a blanket. You ache to remember their face, to reach out, but the memory is a whisper slipping through your grasp. Who are they? Why does the memory feel like a lifeline, and why does it hurt so much to let it go?
The fog draws back as the scene fades, leaving you standing alone in the storm, the weight of the memory settling deep within you. Time is like sand slipping from your fingers; the memory vanishes, leaving only its echo in your heart.
Your resolve hardens. That glimmer of a life, a person who once meant everything, has stirred something inside you. Even if every step forward leads into the unknown, you are determined to find the answers that eluded you, to reclaim the memories that defined you. This storm, however fierce, cannot hold you back.
With renewed purpose, you stride forward, drawn to the pulsing light at the storms center, ready to confront the heart of your past. The path may be treacherous, but you now carry a sliver of hope—perhaps, in this plane of illusions, a truth about who you are awaits.
The heart of the storm beckons, an ever-closer pulse resonating in time with your own. You brace yourself, feeling the swell of memories and emotions churning within, tugging at you with each powerful gust of wind. But something stirs inside you—a determination to press forward, no matter the cost.
<<if $AmountBravery >=2>>
    A rush of courage floods through you, sparking something almost reckless within. Your heart pounds with fierce resolve as you take a steadying breath, then lean forward, sprinting against the relentless gusts. Memories, broken and fragmented, crash over you, each one biting and stinging like shards of glass: moments of fear, of love, of bitter regret—yet you push through, each memory a step closer to the truth buried within the storm.
    For each stride forward, the whirlwind of memories becomes sharper, almost unbearable. You grit your teeth, feeling the sting of forgotten sorrows, the pull of buried secrets. But every painful fragment strengthens you, bolstering your determination.
    <<set $AmountDetermination = $AmountDetermination +1>>
<<else>>
    You stand firm, your feet planted against the earth, shoulders hunched against the storms onslaught. Each step forward feels like wading through thick, biting mist, yet you press on, letting the ache settle in your bones as the memories cut through the fog, one by one. Each memory pulls at you, laced with loss, fear, and moments you had long since buried.
    <<set $AmountDespair = $AmountDespair +1>>
<<endif>>
The doubts rise as your heart clenches, questions swirling like the relentless wind—How much pain lies ahead? Will this storm bring answers, or only more turmoil? But the thought of finding closure, of reaching some end to this endless searching, keeps you moving, step by step, your mind repeating a silent mantra: It will be worth it.
With each laboring step, you brace yourself against the storm, steadying for whatever truth lies at the center of this twisted illusion. The path may be grueling, but something deep within you whispers that it must be done.
As you draw closer, the pulsing light grows in strength, its glow piercing through the fog in brilliant flashes. Every inch closer magnifies the storms force, as if trying to keep you out, to hide whatever lies in its core. The storm is alive, carrying memories that feel too close, voices you almost recognize, and emotions that threaten to tear you apart. But you press on, the memory of that bench, of the figure beside you, urging you forward.
And when you finally, reached the eye of the storm. The pulsating heartbeat that called you forward is now nearly blinding in its intensity, a core of radiant, misty light at the center of this swirling chaos. It floats before you—a sphere of dense, white fog with an almost celestial glow, a miniature sun wrapped in shrouds of whirling mist. Each pulse seems to ripple outward, sending waves through the fog that claw at your heart, dredging up fragments of forgotten moments and unspoken words.
You stand transfixed, feeling the steady thrum of the heart-like glow resonate through your entire being. Its light is harsh yet alluring, every beat sounding almost like a whisper, a soft and distant voice calling to you from the depths of time and memory. Each pulse grows louder, and you feel the voice almost burrowing into your mind.
You close your eyes and listen, straining to make out what it is saying.

	You scoff, crossing your arms as you shoot the crow a pointed glare.
	You: “Oh, sure, hold my hand. Like being stuck here is it not enough. What is this even? Some grand joke? You have been nothing but a snarky, unhelpful little bird, and here I am, wandering around in a place that I do not even understand. I do not know where I am, why I am here, or why you are even following me. And you? You are no help at all, just mocking me from your little perch."
	Your voice starts to rise, teetering on the edge of a rant as the frustration spills out.
	You: “It is like everything is designed to keep me guessing, and here I am — lost, with a crow that talks back but says nothing of value. What even is this place?!”
	You expect another retort from the crow, something sharp and stinging, but to your surprise, the bird says nothing. Instead, it looks at you with an unreadable expression. A moment of silence stretches between you before it spreads its wings and lifts off the ground.
	Without another word, the crow starts to fly away, straight into the vast emptiness ahead. Its wings cut through the air like a quiet whisper, heading away from the door you stepped through.
	<<set $AmountCrowsTriggered = 1>>
        ->Chase after the crow.
		    Your heart lurches, and without thinking, you run after it. The vastness ahead is endless, the white marble stretching as far as your eyes can see, but the crows dark form becomes your only anchor.
		    You race forward, footsteps echoing in the stillness, desperate not to lose sight of the only thing that might lead you to an answer.

	    ->Call out to the crow.
		    Your panic gets the better of you, and before you can stop yourself, you call after the bird.
            You: “Wait! Where are you going?”
		    The crow pauses mid-flight, hovering just far enough to make you feel its distance. It does not look back, but its voice cuts through the emptiness — softer, eerie.
            Crow: “Follow me.”
		    The words send a shallow pang of guilt into your chest, leaving a bitter aftertaste. You did not mean to be so harsh — it is just a crow, after all. The only creature here that talks. Sure, it is irritating, mean at times even, but… it is been with you this whole time, has it not?

->Pry further. <<if $AmountCommunication >=1>>
	You: "What is this place, really?"
	The crow tilts its head, as though considering your question. Its beady eyes reflect the endless white marble floor, and a strange silence fills the air. Then, it speaks with a casual, almost bored tone.
	Crow: "This place? Oh, it is just where reality bends to your indecision. A nice, quiet corner of the Void where things do not quite add up—kind of like you, really."
	The crows voice trails off, and you can not help but feel the weight of its words. The Void... You remember. Is this place even real? Or maybe it is more real than anything you have seen so far.
	<<set $AmountKnowledge = $AmountKnowledge +1>> 
	Crow: “Ah, you have got questions, do you? Always prying... Haven't you learned by now that curiosity can lead to ruin?"
	You pause, despite the weight of the crow's mocking tone. Its beady eyes glimmer with a knowing look, though you can not shake the feeling it is more amused than anything else. Still, this place… this void — no, it feels too familiar. It feels… somehow wrong.

		    You hesitate, something gnawing at you from within. This place, this endless plane of fog and marble, despite its emptiness, feels like something you've known before. A distant memory tugging at your mind, refusing to take shape.
		    You: “Why… does this place feel so familiar?”
		    The words slip out before you can stop them. You glance around, your gaze wandering back to the crow. It perches on a low stone, wings tucked in, watching you with sharp, beady eyes. For the first time, you really look at it—its jet-black feathers, the way it moves.
		    You: “And you… you feel familiar too.”
		    The crow cocks its head to the side, its beak slightly open as though caught off guard for a moment. But then it lets out a sharp caw, breaking the tension, shattering your moment of clarity.
		    Crow: “Oh, please,” it snickers. 
            Crow: “Familiar? Me? Must be all that fog messing with your head.” It flaps its wings mockingly, drawing closer. 
            Crow: “Or maybe you have got your brains scrambled from wandering around too long, hm?”
		    You shake off the crows snark, but the feeling remains. There is something deeper going on here. You look past the fog, at the distant light that seems to come from nowhere. This place is devoid of detail, devoid of life, and yet… it feels like you have been here before. But how could that be?
		    You: “Why does everything here feel so familiar?” You turn to the crow again, voice firmer this time. 
            You: “There is nothing here, and yet… I can not shake the feeling that I know this place.”
		    The crow is silent for a moment, still perched close by. Its head tilts again, eyes gleaming with a strange sort of interest, as if it had been waiting for this question all along. Then, in a voice lower than before, almost rhythmic, the crow begins to speak:
		    "The mirror reflects but shows no face, a dance in circles, an endless chase. In the hollow light, the shadows play,whispering tales to keep you at bay. Threads of memory weave the past, but those who linger will not last. Comfort clings like a familiar friend, yet binds the soul, until the end."
		    Your brow furrows as the crows words echo in your mind, twisting into shapes you can not quite grasp yet.
		    A mirror with no face? Circles… shadows? You think, your thoughts scattered, trying to piece together what it could mean. The words are unsettling, slipping through your understanding like water through fingers.
		    You shake your head, feeling a growing frustration gnaw at the edges of your thoughts. There is something just beyond your reach, some hidden meaning — but it refuses to reveal itself.

->Ask another question. <<if $AmountCuriousity >=1>>
	You: "Why are you here, anyway? Why did you… follow me?"
	The question escapes your lips before you fully register it. You have wondered about the crow ever since it first appeared. It seems to mock you at every turn, but it is always there, hovering in the periphery. Its constant presence feels unsettling but also oddly reassuring, like an unwanted shadow.
	The crow tilts its head, letting out a sharp, short caw as though the question has amused it. It taps its talons on the marble floor, pacing with slow, deliberate steps before finally perching itself on a low stone that appeared seemingly out of nowhere.
	Crow: “Me? Follow you?” It cackles, the sound hollow in the empty space. 
    Crow: “I think you have got it all wrong. I did not choose to follow you. You pulled me here.”
	You frown, not understanding.
	You: "Pulled you here? What are you talking about?"
	The crows eyes gleam, and it flutters its wings, almost as if to shrug off your question.
	Crow: “Think of it as… attachment. You humans are such fascinating creatures, always clinging to things. People, places, memories. You carry all your little baggage around, even when you do not need it. And some of that weight…” It trails off, looking straight at you. “…well, let us just say, some of it takes form.”
	Your heart skips a beat as the crows gaze deepens, its cryptic words sinking in. It feels like the air around you is tightening. What did it mean by attachment? You have always felt the crows presence was more than just coincidence. Could it be connected to something—or someone?

		    You: "So… you are saying I brought you here. But why? I do not even know you."
		    The crow narrows its eyes, an expression both pitying and amused.
		    Crow: “Oh, but you do. Or at least, you knew something like me once. You are clinging to the past, clinging to fragments. What I am… what I have become is just another part of your illusion, your little reflection of reality.”
		    You stagger at its words, trying to piece together the meaning. This whole place, the Plane of Illusion—it is been twisting your mind since you stepped in. And now the crow is suggesting that it is somehow tied to your own memories, your own emotions?
		    You: "So… you're not real. Just… part of this illusion."
		    The crow lets out a dismissive caw, fluttering its wings again.
		    Crow: “Real? Illusion? Does it matter? I am here now, am I not? Besides, you do not seem to be in a position to decide what is real and what is not.” It pauses, its beak twitching as it regards you with an inscrutable look. 
            Crow: “I did not decide to follow you. You decided that I should follow. There is something in you that needs me. And until you figure out what that is, I will be right here. Right at your side, through every step of this strange little journey of yours.”
		    The words hang in the air, leaving you feeling unnerved, yet something stirs in you—a strange realization that this crow is somehow tethered to your past, to some unresolved part of yourself that you have buried or forgotten. A sense of unease mixes with the smallest glimmer of understanding. It follows because you made it so.
		    You: "And if I figure it out? If I find out what you are?"
		    The crow's beak curves again in that unsettling smile-like gesture.
		    Crow: “Well, little human, we will just have to see, will we? But do not get too ahead of yourself. You are still lost, after all.”

	You decide you have had enough of the crows riddles. Its words swirl in your mind like the fog in the distance, but you refuse to get drawn into its game. Whatever it is, whatever this thing is, you will figure it out on your own terms. Without a word, you turn your back to the crow and start walking.
	Crow: “Ah… so that is it then?” the crow caws, flapping its wings as it takes off from its perch. It circles above you, its mocking tone still sharp in your ears. 
    Crow: “No more questions? No more curiosity? I thought you wanted answers.”
	You keep walking, your eyes fixed ahead on the endless expanse of the marble floor. Your footsteps echo faintly, swallowed by the vastness around you. The fog remains distant, a ghostly boundary that offers no sense of direction.
	Crow: “You are running again. Always running.” The crow flies low now, hovering just above your head. 
    Crow: “But where do you think you will go? This place stretches on forever. You will just wander… endlessly.”
	You grit your teeth, determined not to let its words slow you down. But with every step, the ground beneath you feels more uncertain. The fog ahead seems no closer. It is like walking through a dream where the landscape never changes, where progress is an illusion.

As you chase after the crow, your heart pounds in your chest, a frantic rhythm that matches the echo of your footsteps against the smooth marble floor. The fog in the distance swirls and shifts, creating an illusion of movement that keeps you on edge.
Why did You respond like that? The thought creeps in, guilt settling in your stomach like a stone. The crow was just being itself, and here you are, snapping back like a fool. It is not like I have anyone else to rely on in this… this endless place.
Your breath comes in sharp gasps, the cold air stinging your lungs, but the crow leads you on, a shadow darting effortlessly through the mist. You stumble slightly, catching yourself just in time to keep running. The smooth surface beneath your feet feels alien, each step a reminder of how disoriented you truly are.
With every stride, the weight of your earlier sarcasm presses down on you, and you can not help but wonder if you pushed away the only companion you have in this bewildering realm. The crow glances back, its beady eyes glinting with an almost playful defiance, urging you to keep moving forward.
The environment blurs into a haze of white and gray, the fog swallowing the edges of your vision, yet you push on, driven by the need to make sense of it all — and maybe, just maybe, to find some semblance of understanding in here.

Just as you begin to collect yourself, something stirs in the distance. Far beyond the endless marble floor, past the thick fog, you glimpse faint, shifting shadows. Shapes that flicker and vanish almost as soon as they appear.
And then, voices.
Muffled, distorted, but unmistakably human. You squint, straining to make sense of what you're seeing and hearing. There are... people. Blurred figures moving through the mist, their silhouettes vague, but familiar in a way you canot quite grasp. Laughter echoes faintly, followed by a soft murmur of conversation. One voice, in particular, tugs at something deep within you—a sense of warmth, of safety.
A flicker of recognition flashes through your mind, sending a surge of hope into your chest. Is that... someone I know? You take a step forward instinctively, but the images ripple, distorting further as you approach. The voices grow quieter, fainter. Your heartbeat quickens, and for a moment, you believe you are on the verge of remembering—of grasping something tangible.
But the fog thickens, swallowing the fragments whole. The figures blur into nothingness, the voices fading to whispers before disappearing entirely.
You stop. Confusion and frustration tighten your throat. Who were they? You try to recall their faces, their names, but your mind refuses to give them to you. The light of recognition dims just as quickly as it appeared, slipping through your fingers like water. Still, the brief glimpse sparks something within you—a glimmer of hope, faint but real.
Maybe... there is something here after all, you think. Something You have forgotten. Something important.
More fleeting images begin to dance at the edges of your vision—tiny, fleeting hallucinations that hover just out of reach. A hand reaching out, a burst of laughter, shadows of people passing through your peripheral vision. It is all so distant, so distorted, but it is something.
And you hold onto that little thread of hope. You do not know what it means, but it is enough to keep you going. Enough to keep you from sinking into despair.

You pause, glancing around the maze with an unsettled feeling prickling at the back of your neck. The walls, the silence, the stillness—it all feels watchful, as if something unseen lingers just beyond the edges of your vision. Turning to the crow, you ask: 
You: “Do you… feel it too? Like we are being watched?”
The crow tilts its head, considering your question. It waits, a dramatic pause stretching long enough to make you wonder if it is deliberately trying to keep you in suspense. Finally, it answers with a cryptic lilt, 
Crow: “No one here but you could watch me, you know.”
Confused, you turn back to the crow, brow furrowed. But it only laughs at your expression, a sharp, teasing sound.
Crow: “Oh, do not worry so much,” it says, its voice dripping with a curious mixture of amusement and foreboding. 
Crow: “There are worse things than a set of invisible eyes.”
The foreboding tone of its last words lingers heavily in the air, like the faintest whiff of smoke before a fire. It is enough to unsettle you, to keep you rooted in place, wondering what else the crow might know.

The tension in the air feels as thick as the fog itself, gnawing at you, heightening your frustration with every step. You are caught in an endless loop of dread, fear, and confusion, a storm of emotions churning inside without an outlet. Every step feels like a stumble in the dark, with something intangible pressing down on you. Before you even realize it, anger starts to bubble up. It is an impulse, a sudden surge of defiance—a refusal to be toyed with any longer.
In a burst of frustration, you shout into the mist.
You: “What do you want from me?! What sense does any of this make?!” Your voice echoes through the fog, defiant and raw.
The crow, who had been hovering nearby, stares at you with a mixture of curiosity and irritation, giving you a sharp side-eye.
Crow: “Did you really have to shout like that?” it mutters in a low, unimpressed voice. 
Crow:“I did not expect…this reaction, to be honest. And yelling is not going to change anything anyway—”
Before it can finish, the sky rumbles, a deafening clap of thunder rolling through the thick haze. In an instant, the fog heaves forward, lunging toward you both with a terrifying force. You barely have time to turn before it engulfs you, leaving nothing but a shroud of thick, churning mist around you.
The air fills with a piercing wind, shrieking through the fog, so loud you are forced to cover your ears. The fog, swirling heavily around you, distorts everything—thick, dark layers obscuring your view. You hear only snatches of sound, whispers echoing from every direction. Flickers of images start to appear in the fog itself: familiar faces, memories just beyond your reach, fragments of people and places you recognize but can not fully place.
The crow, shaken, breaks the silence with a surprised and irritated tone,
Crow: “What did you do?!” it hisses, clearly unsettled by the sudden, powerful reaction of the fog. Its gaze is sharp, an edge of blame in its eyes.
You can not help but wonder… did your outburst actually cause this? Did it alter something? Or did the fog respond to something deep within you, to the fury you could not keep bottled up? A sense of both exhilaration and unease settles over you, knowing you have provoked a change—though what that change means, you have yet to find out.

With a faint glint in its eye, the crow shifts to a more serious tone and leans close. “Since you are so curious… here is something for you.”
Crow: “The mirror reflects but shows no face, A dance in circles, an endless chase. In the hollow light, the shadows play, Whispering tales to keep you at bay. Threads of memory weave the past, But those who linger will not last. Comfort clings like a familiar friend, Yet binds the soul, until the end.”

In the stillness, you pause, recalling the riddle the crow had cryptically shared. Its words echo in your mind as you try to piece together the meaning hidden within its verses:
“The mirror reflects but shows no face,

In the hollow light, the shadows play,
Whispering tales to keep you at bay.
Threads of memory weave the past,
But those who linger will not last.
Comfort clings like a familiar friend,
Yet binds the soul, until the end.”
The lines feel layered and obscure, yet strangely familiar, resonating with the shadows and winding paths of this place. You start to wonder if the answer might reveal a clue to escape or to understand this fog-veiled realm.

After careful reflection, you feel a spark of insight. The words of the riddle hint at the cyclical nature of this place, a mirrored prison of memory and illusion. The fog, the maze, the feeling of being watched—it all connects. Perhaps this place is meant to trap those who linger, clinging to past memories, or it is an illusion to distract you from something beyond.
With this revelation, a sense of determination fills you. You feel as if you are beginning to understand the places intentions, and a newfound hope stirs in you. With a deep breath, you turn to the crow, who watches you closely.
Crow: “Well, well,” it says, nodding approvingly. 
Crow: “Seems you have cracked the code. You might be smarter than you look.”
You: "What is this place, really?"
The crow flaps its wings once, as if to shake off the question. It hovers before you, dark feathers outlined starkly against the pale, endless expanse.
Crow: “This place, curious one, is where the forgotten come to fade, to scatter into the nothingness they have become.” The voice softens, though not out of kindness. 
The smooth marble beneath your feet is all you can feel, but it is as if something more lies beneath the surface. You bend down, running a hand along the floor. The chill, the smoothness, the fog curling along the edges of your vision—it feels like a veneer, hiding something far worse.
You set your gaze toward the fog. Steeling yourself with new purpose, you march forward to investigate the fogs depths, ready to confront whatever awaits.

Crow: “Not everyone is meant to understand everything,” it says softly, with an odd gentleness. 
Crow: “And sometimes, it is better not to. Just face what is ahead. There is nothing else to be done here.” Its words carry a strange finality, a warning that hums in the back of your mind.
Resigned, you nod. Whatever lies beyond, you will have to face it without answers. As you and the crow move forward, a sense of uncertainty shadows your steps, but you press on, ready to meet whatever lies in the fog.

You approach the fog cautiously, feeling a strange, magnetic pull urging you closer. The mist seems to ripple and swirl as if alive, whispering with faint, indistinct murmurs that hover just beyond comprehension. You squint, hoping to catch a glimpse of something, anything, within the dense haze, but all you see are shifting shadows—ghostly echoes suspended in the fog.
With each step forward, your footsteps become muffled, swallowed by the thickening air. The silence around you is almost palpable, broken only by the occasional whisper—familiar yet elusive voices drifting on the edge of your memory.
Crow: “Curiosity, eh? You are determined to pry at shadows, find something tangible in a world made of half-truths?” The crow lets out a low chuckle, though a glint of interest sparks in its eyes. 
Crow: “Well, have at it. I will be here to laugh if you stumble.”
You ignore the crows taunt, feeling a renewed sense of purpose despite its sarcasm. Somewhere in this fog lies a clue, a fragment of the truth about this place—or about yourself. The mist parts slightly, giving you a fleeting glimpse of a shadowy figure in the distance. Instinctively, you move closer, eager to get a better look, but as soon as you take another step, the fog thickens again, and the figure dissolves.
A sense of frustration mingles with your curiosity. You take a deep breath, steadying yourself, determined to push through this spectral veil. Then, just as the fog appears to tighten around you, you hear a familiar sound—a soft voice, almost musical, like a memory calling from afar.
You: "Who...?"
The voice feels close, like someone just over your shoulder, yet when you turn, there is no one there. Instead, you see a new shadow, smaller, and moving just out of reach. The fog toys with you, pulling this shadow into sight only to have it slip away again, vanishing as soon as you draw near. Each sound, each shifting shade of grey, beckons you to keep going.
A sudden chill sweeps over you, tugging at a distant memory. You are reminded of someone close, their laughter or their touch—a moment lost in the fog of time. The weight of their absence pulls at your heart, but it is barely tangible, an emotion more than a thought. What were they to you? Why does their presence haunt you here?
You press onward, bracing yourself against the eerie quiet and flickering memories. For a moment, you feel as though the fog thickens, growing into an endless maze of grey. Every now and then, you think you hear a word, a name, or a laugh drift through the mist, each sound so soft it almost feels imagined.
Crow: “Careful now. I would hate to see you lose yourself chasing ghosts. Though, maybe that is what you are meant to do here—lose yourself to find… yourself?”
A hint of annoyance flares in you at the crows cryptic tone, but it fades as you realize there is truth in its words. The fog is more than an illusion; it is a place of memories. If you could only reach far enough, peer deep enough, maybe you could pull these fragments together into something real.
Suddenly, a brief spark of light flares in the fog, illuminating a small clearing up ahead. You feel a flicker of hope—a promise that, just maybe, you are on the right path. Without hesitation, you head toward the light, the voices around you growing softer but clearer, their words almost forming sentences, yet disappearing before you can grasp their meaning.

	You step deeper into the fog, braving the whispers and hazy shadows that swirl and ripple around you. Each step forward feels like a step backward, yet a voice within urges you onward. Your thoughts drift to an obstacle—an enigma waiting in the mist. Then, as the fog shifts and parts, you see it: a labyrinthine structure rising from the ground, ethereal and puzzling, like a series of floating paths interwoven with fragments of memories.
	In the stillness, the crows voice breaks the silence.
	Crow: “Curiosity and memories—an odd mix. I wonder, what truths do you hope to uncover in this maze of ghosts?”
	Ignoring the crows musings, you survey the maze, feeling a strange sense of familiarity. As you take a cautious step forward, the fog thickens around you, each pathway in the labyrinth tugging at your mind, triggering flashes of the life you can not quite remember. Four distinct memories seem to lie hidden within this maze, each promising glimpses of your past.
	The maze seems endless, the shadowy corridors weaving in and out of each other, bending like the threads of a half-forgotten dream. As you trudge along, something heavy and nameless gnaws at the edges of your mind. Fragments of memories flicker in and out of focus—images, feelings, sensations that only deepen the hollow ache within you. You are not sure how long you have been wandering. Time feels shapeless here, stretching and compressing like an illusion.
	Finally, you stop, leaning against the rough surface of a wall, breathing heavily. Your thoughts scatter, your mind on the brink of unraveling under the weight of questions with no answers. Who were those people? Who was that person who held your hand in the shadows of that memory? What did it feel like to be you, back then, with so much love, passion, fear?
	Crow: "Ah, finally running out of steam?" The crows voice cuts through your thoughts, its usual mockery sharpened by an oddly perceptive gaze. 
	Crow: "Looking a bit bedraggled, are you not? A little worse for wear?”
	You ignore it, too exhausted to retort, your gaze lost somewhere in the twisting paths ahead.
	Crow: "Lost something in that big head of yours?” the crow continues, its voice shifting to a softer, almost thoughtful tone. 
	Crow: "Well, I suppose it is no surprise—walking blind without purpose is bound to be tiring. Perhaps you'd like a riddle instead?" It chuckles, dark feathers ruffling.
	A moment of silence passes, then the crow leans closer, whispering- 
	Crow: “What is the spark that lights your soul's fire? Find that, and let the path choose you.”
	The words barely register, blending into the murmur of your weary thoughts. But as you close your eyes, something clicks—a recognition buried deep, the fragment of an answer just out of reach. You wonder, is it a purpose? A truth? Or something you want more than anything, the thing that drives you forward even when the darkness creeps in?
	A flicker of realization dawns, and you start to speak, almost in a whisper: “Maybe… it is… what I want most.”

	Crow: “Wait, are we actually turning around?” It sounds half-amused, half-disbelieving. 
	Crow: “I know I suggested the mysterious voice thing was a bad idea, but... this is bold even for you!”
	You give it a resolute nod, continuing forward in defiance of the mazes pull. With a shrug and a low chuckle, the crow flaps its wings and flies above, keeping an eye on you from the skies as you walk.

title: MemoryLove

You pause as the fog parts, revealing a small clearing within the endless haze. Soft, glowing lights hover around you, pulsing gently, like fireflies caught in a slow, rhythmic dance. A warmth fills the air, familiar and haunting, carrying with it a bittersweet ache you can not quite place. You take a step forward, and with it, a face—blurred and soft—comes into focus in your mind. The details elude you, like trying to recall a dream upon waking, yet the feeling they evoke is unmistakable.
They are close, a presence just out of reach, yet their touch feels as real as the ground beneath your feet. Fingers intertwined, a hand brushing against yours, a voice you can not quite hear but know once held a world of meaning. And then, laughter—a quiet, shared joy that speaks of moments spent together, of intimacy and understanding. You feel their warmth, their steady presence, and a pang in your chest that echoes with longing.
Your heart tightens, heavy with an unfamiliar ache as the realization sinks in. Whoever this person was, they meant everything. The memory of their embrace lingers, and with it, the strange, undeniable sense that something irreplaceable has slipped through your fingers.
Why can you not remember? Why does it feel like part of you has been lost?, you think to yourselve in silence.
You clench your fists, frustration and sadness swirling within you. The need to know them, to grasp this shadow from your past, tugs at you, but every attempt to hold onto the image only causes it to blur further, slipping back into the fog. The yearning lingers, a faint echo of who you might have been with them—a taste of connection, of being truly seen. And now, all that remains is a void, as if someone precious has been erased from your soul, leaving only a hollow ache.
The ache in your chest remains, a hollow void echoing with the specter of a love you can not recall. You glance around, searching the fog as if the memory might somehow linger there. But there is only emptiness, and the echo of your own yearning.
The crow lands nearby, cocking its head with that familiar, unreadable gaze. 
<<if $AmountCrowsFavour >=1>>
	You take a breath, deciding to ask.
	You:“Have you ever… had someone,” you begin, your voice low, hesitant. 
	You: “Someone who understood you, who made you feel... good just existing. Have you ever felt that?”
	For a moment, the crow says nothing. It seems almost taken aback, like the question has somehow reached past its sardonic mask. Its feathers ruffle slightly as if disturbed by some faint, unseen breeze. A silence falls between you, broken only by the soft hum of the fog swirling around. The crows dark eyes reflect a quiet, distant contemplation, and you find yourself studying its features—sharp, intent, eyes that hold a history all their own, yet reveal so little. You wonder what your connection to this creature truly is, why it is so intent on guiding you… or taunting you.
	Finally, the crow lets out a low, almost reluctant murmur, its usual mocking tone softened. 
	Crow: “Yes,” it says simply. The word is dull, almost hollow. It hangs in the air, weighed down by an unspoken past, as if to admit it is to dredge up something long buried.
    But before you can ask anything , the crow abruptly flaps its wings, turning from you and darting toward the next exit ahead, its usual jauntiness muted. It leaves no room for further questions, no hint that it wants to speak of this again.
    You feel a lingering curiosity and sadness, watching it fly away without another word. Why did it answer like that? you wonder. What does it not want to reveal?
    But something within you respects the silence. After all, you can not even remember this person who brought you warmth and belonging, so how could you press the crow to bare its own scars? With a quiet sigh, you turn back to the memory-lit garden, its faint lights seeming dimmer now, like fading stars.
    You take one last, lingering look, feeling the emptiness the memory has left behind, and then follow the crow, stepping back into the maze, back into the unknown.

    You stand in the clearing, the warmth of the memory still lingering, like an ember flickering in the depths of your heart. Though you can not grasp the face or name of the one who made you feel this way, a sense of longing and strength wells within you, driving you to press forward. You glance toward the crow, its sharp gaze watching you with its usual guarded curiosity. You feel an unexpected comfort in its presence, though it is made no effort to soften the journey or offer much in the way of sympathy. Still, its presence reminds you that you are not entirely alone here.
    There is more to find, you tell yourself. Answers. Connections. Maybe even… that person, somehow.
    With a renewed sense of purpose, you take a steadying breath, letting the memory settle within you as both a beacon and a burden. The ache of not knowing burns a little less brightly now; it has transformed into a quiet resolve. You give one last look to the fading lights of the clearing, imprinting them in your mind as a promise to yourself.
    Then, without another word, you turn back to the maze, ready to continue down its winding paths, driven by the hope that somewhere, somehow, you will find more of the truth—and perhaps, even find them.

The path expands into a quiet alcove, and scattered around are fragments of a forgotten passion—brushes, aged with use and still faintly speckled with color; canvases, some painted, others waiting to be filled; papers with lines of poetry, half-formed and raw, brimming with untamed ideas. Symbols of old philosophies and sketches of worlds once imagined lie before you, each carrying a familiar touch.
As you reach out to touch one of the paintbrushes, a faint surge of energy flares within. It is a feeling of purpose, of boundless curiosity, and of the thrill that came with creating. You can almost remember the feeling of being wholly engrossed, the quiet satisfaction that came from losing yourself in your work. The spark that once drove you to learn, to push boundaries and embrace the unknown, feels almost tangible.
But then, as you linger in that nostalgia, an unexpected emptiness slips in—a hollow, unsettling void that sits just beneath the surface of your memories. The passion, the drive, seems to have faded, and you can not grasp why or how. A subtle unease twists in your chest, like a shadow of something darker, buried just out of reach.
You used to feel so much. You wanted to create, to understand. What happened to that eagerness, that drive? Why does it feel like… like something gnawed it away, left only this emptiness in its place?
Your gaze drifts over the remnants of your past, but they now feel distant, like relics belonging to someone else. The warmth of the memory fades into a strange chill, settling into an unshakable question: Was this passion stolen from you, or did you let it go?
A flutter of wings pulls you from your thoughts as the crow perches nearby, watching with its beady eyes. It seems almost amused, tilting its head as if sizing you up.
Crow: "All those pretty colors, all those big ideas… and here you are, looking lost in them. What is the matter? Realizing you have misplaced a piece or two of yourself?"
You meet its gaze, feeling strangely vulnerable under its scrutiny, but unwilling to reveal the fear gnawing at the edges of your mind.
<<if $AmountCrowsFavour >=2>>
	You hesitate, then decide to ask
	You: “Have you ever had something—a purpose, a passion—make you feel… whole? Like you could just exist, and that was enough?”
	For a moment, the crow says nothing, an uncharacteristic silence hanging in the air. Its eyes grow distant, as if recalling something buried, something almost forgotten. In the quiet, you catch a glimmer of something unspoken in its gaze—a softness rarely seen.
	You watch the crow, studying the way it seems lost in its own thoughts, and you wonder about the creature perched beside you, its cryptic words and taunting remarks. What drives it to stay with you? Why does it care if you find answers, or if you remain lost?
	Then, with a faint sigh, the crow simply mutters, "Yes." Its tone is quiet, dulled, as if it holds a story it is unwilling to share.
	Without another word, it takes flight, circling toward the exit. You watch as it flutters ahead, clearly not wanting to linger here any longer. A pang of curiosity rises within you, but you respect its silence, knowing you would not have anything more to share in return.
	As the crows form fades into the shadows, you take a final glance at the creative remnants scattered around you. With a mix of longing and quiet resignation, you turn to follow, leaving behind this fragment of who you once were.

	You feel a surge of energy as the memory flickers, an echo of your old ambition reminding you to keep moving forward. Turning away from the remnants of your past, you cast a quick glance toward the crow, feeling strangely empowered by its presence. Though it makes no effort to soften your path, it serves as a constant, a reminder that you are not entirely alone.
	With newfound resolve, you nod to yourself, setting your sights back on the maze, ready to uncover more. Maybe even find… someone… that understands that spark, you think.
	You leave the alcove behind, striding back into the maze, casting one last, longing look at the memory before stepping back into the winding paths.

You wander further into the maze, the fog twisting and thinning, revealing an open space with objects scattered about like relics of a forgotten past. There is a strange comfort to the area, a familiarity that both warms and constricts you. The air is heavy, filled with a silence that feels thicker than the fog. Around you, the faint outlines of furniture appear—an old rocking chair, a tattered quilt folded over the back of a couch, and a small table strewn with odd trinkets. They remind you of home, or at least what you think a home might have once felt like.
The sight tugs at something within you, stirring a faint but undeniable ache. As you continue through the space, the dim light reveals walls adorned with symbols and remnants of what feel like old family mementos. A worn, dusty clock ticks faintly in the distance, each beat echoing like a heartbeat. Alongside it, faint whispers almost slip through the silence—just barely perceptible, like voices locked in memory.
You are drawn to a tall stone pillar at the center of the space, standing alone with an air of quiet significance. Resting atop the pillar is a picture frame, its edges chipped and tarnished, as though it is been weathered by time. The glass is broken, but instead of a photo, there is only an empty canvas inside the frame, barren and blank.
You reach out, fingertips brushing the cracked glass. Something feels off, something you can not quite place. 
You: “Why…is there no picture here?” you murmur, a knot of unease twisting in your chest.
Your fingers trace the edges of the frame, adjusting it, tilting it to the light, as though an image might magically appear. There is a sense that this frame once held something important—something you can not afford to forget. But as you search, trying to feel out the missing piece, that same knot of unease deepens, building into a tight ball of anxiety. The quiet space around you begins to feel claustrophobic, the fog closing in, and a bone-deep panic rises within you, sharp and paralyzing.
Your hands begin to tremble uncontrollably, the surge of panic overwhelming you as memories, half-formed and indistinct, claw at your mind, just beyond reach. The feeling is terrifyingly intense, spreading through your veins like ice. You try to breathe, to hold onto something tangible, but it is as though the air itself is draining from your lungs. Then, just as suddenly, the sensation shifts. The overwhelming terror drains away, replaced by a strange, pervasive numbness that settles over you like a heavy blanket. The restlessness in your mind quiets, silencing your thoughts completely.
For a long, weightless moment, you just stand there, feeling the emptiness inside—the calm that does not feel quite right. It is neither painful nor comforting, just… nothing. You turn the frame over in your hands, yet still feel nothing, no desire to fill in the gaps.
The crows sharp voice pierces the silence, pulling you back with an oddly uneasy note. 
Crow: “Lost in thought, are we?” it asks, half-mocking but tinged with a rare hint of uncertainty. 
Crow: “Care to share with me your brilliant musings?”
Without thinking, you respond, the words slipping out in a monotone. 
You: “Nothing. I am thinking about… nothing.”
You glance up, catching sight of the crow. For once, its gaze is not taunting or curious; instead, its head is cocked, feathers ruffled, a look of what might be genuine unease crossing its face. The crow seems spooked, its bright eyes wide and fixed on you as though it is seen something that should not be there. It opens its beak as though to say something else, but you turn away, releasing the frame and stepping back from the pillar, an intense urge to leave gripping you.
You do not give the crow a chance to respond, the need to escape this space overriding any impulse to linger. With a glance over your shoulder, you leave the clearing, stepping back into the winding paths of the maze, feeling the weight of the empty frame lingering behind you.

You step into a section of the maze where shadows slither along the walls, coiling and writhing as though alive. The darkness here feels different, thicker, as if it is pressing in on you, growing heavier with every breath. In the dim light, figures begin to emerge, vague outlines that hint at faces you feel you should know, but they are distorted, blurred by time or something more insidious. You try to look closer, to make out a detail, any feature that might help you remember—but the figures shift, slipping out of reach, dissolving before they can solidify.
A strange, dull ache settles in your chest, an ache that feels more real than these phantoms, more painful than the shadows swirling around you. The memory is fractured, like a mirror broken into pieces, and yet, each shard cuts, leaving a lingering sting. You reach for the memory, as though by sheer will you might bring it back, but it resists you, slipping away no matter how tightly you try to hold onto it.
A soft, mocking sound breaks the silence as the crow lands beside you, its sharp eyes glinting in the shadows. 
Crow: Found yourself a puzzle, have you?” it taunts, hopping a little closer to the shifting figures. 
Crow: “Can not quite make it out, can you? Oh, the limits of memory…”
You ignore the crows jabs, feeling the need to grasp at something, to pull something concrete from this mist of half-formed images. One figure stands out to you, lingering at the edge of the fog, just beyond reach. Something about them feels hauntingly familiar, and a wave of hurt and betrayal courses through you. It is visceral, an old wound that suddenly throbs to life. The words come unbidden, your voice barely a whisper.
You: “Was it… my fault?”
Your question hangs in the air, raw and vulnerable, but the crow, usually so quick to respond, says nothing. Its silence unsettles you more than any answer could. The bird only watches, its bright eyes uncharacteristically still and somber, refusing to meet your gaze.
The silence presses down, thick and stifling, filling the space between you and the ghostly figures. The crow remains silent, looking away, and the betrayal in your chest deepens, tinged with an unfamiliar sadness. You swallow hard, the bitterness of the unanswered question lingering on your tongue. Without knowing why, you suddenly feel too exposed, too raw to stay here any longer.
Your hands clench at your sides as you back away from the figures, each step filling you with a mounting sense of urgency to leave. Turning, you make your way back to the twisted paths of the maze, feeling the weight of that question—a question that will follow you, unanswered, into the shadows.

As you continue through the twisting maze, anticipation gnaws at the edges of your thoughts. Each corner you turn, every shadow that stretches across the walls, fills you with the hope—or perhaps the fear—that something might be waiting for you there, some lost fragment of yourself ready to reveal its secrets. But each step brings only emptiness. The air is still, and the maze seems devoid of the strange moments and memories that have haunted you so far. It's just silence, the winding paths repeating themselves as though caught in a loop.
You pause, glancing around, feeling an odd sense of unease settle in. The quiet feels wrong somehow, hollow, as though something is intentionally missing. This place has always given you visions, echoes of the past—but now, there is nothing. The emptiness itself feels almost deliberate, like the maze is withholding something from you.
A rustle breaks the silence, and the crow lands beside you, ruffling its feathers as it gives you an amused look. It studies your expression for a moment, head tilted.
Crow: “Disappointed?” it croaks, its voice sharp with mockery. 
Crow: “Were you hoping for some grand revelation? A flickering memory to weep over?”
You glare at it but say nothing. A strange, uneasy emptiness gnaws at you, the kind that is less about loss and more about absence, about the hollow spaces left behind when something has simply ceased to exist. You shake your head, as if to clear it, but the feeling lingers.
Crow: “What is the matter?” the crow presses, its tone bordering on playful. 
Crow: “Did you think every corner would hold some forgotten piece of you? Maybe the labyrinth is running dry. Maybe there is nothing left to show you.”
You grit your teeth, forcing yourself to move forward, trying to ignore the uneasy feeling growing inside you. The crow hops beside you, eyes glinting with what almost looks like satisfaction.
It leans in, its beak close to your ear as it murmurs.
Crow: “Perhaps not everything in here is meant to be found. Some things slip away for a reason.”
A chill runs through you, and you feel compelled to press on, as if somehow, by moving forward, you might fill the void inside. You do not respond to the crow this time, refusing to give it the satisfaction. Instead, you quicken your pace, leaving the empty path and its strange emptiness behind you, hoping that somewhere ahead, there might be answers—something more than this endless silence.

You replay the strange encounter in your mind, trying to grasp its meaning, but each time, it slips away like mist through your fingers. The twisted, grey stone walls loom on either side, narrowing in places, pulling you forward in an unpredictable spiral. Shadows cling to the edges of each passage, and though the silence is heavy, it feels almost… watchful.
Then, breaking through the silence, the crow calls out from somewhere above, its voice sharp and curious. 
Crow:“Hey! Do you hear it too?”
You frown, looking up, half-expecting to see something unusual in the shifting shadows. 
You:“Hear what?”
But before the crow can respond, a faint whisper reaches your ears, so soft it could almost be imagined.
FaintVoice: “Here… come here,” it beckons, each word carrying an eerie allure. 
It drifts from just around a corner to your left, hidden in the dim, winding passage.
Your pulse quickens, a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity tugging at you. You stare at the corner, heart pounding, uncertain of what might lie in wait—what might be lurking there, just out of sight. It could be anything… or anyone. The thought freezes you in place, caught between dread and the gnawing need to know.
But then, with a carefree laugh, the crow swoops forward, wings brushing lightly against the maze walls. 
Crow: “A voice in a dark place? Always the right choice to follow it!” it jokes, glancing back at you with a mischievous glint in its eye. 
Crow: “Besides, what is the worst that could happen? Geting lost forever and then dying is off the table here anyway… or have you not noticed?”
Its words are cryptic, carrying implications that leave you with more questions than comfort, but before you can respond, the crow has already rounded the corner. You hesitate, swallowing against the nervous knot in your throat, and take a reluctant step forward.
With each step, the whisper grows louder, morphing from a distant murmur into a soft chant that beckons you closer. The maze seems to shift around you, walls curling like vines, winding tighter as if herding you toward some unseen destination. The air thickens, weighed down by the scent of wet stone and a faint trace of something floral, almost like old roses. The shadows seem to pulse, reacting to your presence, an eerie pulse of life within the walls.
Then, as you follow the faint whisper, the walls open up into an enormous, ethereal garden.
You step into the garden, and the shift is overwhelming. After the cold, oppressive corridors, this place feels like a sanctuary—a sprawling garden that stretches beyond what you imagined could be hidden within the mazes twisting, lifeless walls. Lush, vibrant greenery greets you, dotted with bursts of colors from flowers in bloom, their petals glistening in soft, filtered light. The air here feels different, heavy with the scent of earth and life, almost sweet.
Ahead of you rises a grand greenhouse with a round, glass roof that gleams in the muted light. It stands in the center of the garden like a sacred structure, its walls woven with ivy and climbing plants that twist up toward the domed glass. There are four entrances—north, east, south, and west—all leading inward to what feels like the beating heart of this hidden paradise. You take a step closer, feeling as if something in this place recognizes you, remembers you, even though it remains silent and untouched.
The crow flutters to your side, its eyes scanning the garden with a mix of curiosity and something almost like awe, though its voice remains playfully mocking.
Crow: “Well, is it not this charming? All those bleak memories, and now this—like someone is saving the best for last, just for you.”
You ignore it, drawn by the sheer tranquility of the space. Flowers in hues of pink, blue, and white line the paths leading to the greenhouse. The arrangements are oddly familiar, as though each plant was chosen for a purpose beyond mere beauty. There is a strange connection stirring within you, something you can not quite grasp. You pause beside a cluster of delicate, bell-shaped flowers swaying gently, and as you reach out to touch one, a vague feeling brushes the edges of your mind—a sense of something lost, or perhaps forgotten.
The crow perches on a nearby bench, giving you a sidelong glance.
Crow: “Ah, do not tell me these flowers are giving you a case of the sentimental blues? Or maybe just another piece of your fractured memory.”
You ignore its words again, focusing on the plants around you. Some look almost familiar, though you can't remember their names or where you might have seen them before. Still, their presence feels oddly comforting, like fragments of something meaningful buried beneath layers of forgotten time. Ivy climbs the greenhouse walls, intertwining with the frame, each leaf a vibrant testament to the life that has taken root here.
The crow hops along beside you as you explore, casting curious glances at the greenhouse.
Crow: “I will admit, I do not mind this place. A little too neat and perfect, but at least it is not a dark maze.”
There is an air of care within the greenhouse and the garden, an attention to detail that seems almost reverent. Every leaf and petal seems carefully tended, the soil fresh, the vines groomed as if someone has been here recently—someone who cares deeply. Yet, as you look around, there is no one in sight.
You continue walking, taking in the intricate patterns of life around you, the way the plants seem to spill over from every crevice, blooming freely yet somehow controlled.
The crow breaks the silence once more, watching you with an unreadable expression.
Crow: “Whoever made this place knew what they were doing, would you not say? Not a single flower out of place.” It lets out a soft laugh. 
Crow: “Almost feels like home—if I had one.”
You hesitate at that, glancing at the crow. There is something different in its tone, a fleeting moment of something genuine. But it is gone as quickly as it came, and the crow takes off, circling above before landing in front of the greenhouse.
Crow: “Well? You are not going to just stand there, are you? Let us see what treasures await us inside this little Eden.”
It hops toward the northern entrance, leaving you to follow. You take a last look around the garden, feeling an inexplicable longing, a deep-seated urge to stay.
->Stay longer.
	You pause at the threshold of the greenhouse, the faint, almost magnetic pull within tempting you forward. Yet, something deeper keeps you rooted in place, as though there is more to see, more to understand about this hidden sanctuary.
	You glance back at the crow, who is watching you with a curious tilt of its head.
	You: “I… I think I will stay here a little longer. There is something about this place—something I can not quite explain.”
	The crow narrows its eyes thoughtfully, ruffling its feathers before giving a careless shrug.

		Crow: “Oh, and do not get yourself into trouble, alright?” With that, it disappears inside, leaving you alone in the garden is stillness.

The gentle sounds of leaves rustling and the quiet, earthy hum of life fill the air as you step further into the garden. Your hand brushes over clusters of wildflowers, each bloom a fragment of something elusive and distant, yet familiar. A soft wind stirs the vines around you, and you are certain, just for a moment, that you hear faint whispers. They drift in and out, too quiet to make sense of, yet persistent, like fragments of old dreams resurfacing.
Everywhere you turn, there is something to catch your eye: a vine trailing across an old stone bench, delicate flowers cascading down a low wall, the faint outline of footsteps along a garden path. It is as if this place has been carefully tended for years, waiting for you, holding memories you can not yet access but feel in your bones. Each breath here is filled with warmth, a sense of life that feels distinctly personal, as if parts of you were rooted here, hidden among the flowers and leaves.
You glance at the greenhouse, its doors beckoning, but linger a moment longer, soaking in the unspoken stories. For now, they remain silent, but something about this place tells you that the answers—pieces of yourself, maybe—are not so far beyond reach.

As you wander through the garden, your gaze falls on a small bed of lilies, each bloom carefully tended and vibrant. They seem to glow softly in the dappled sunlight, delicate petals unfurling in shades of white and faint blush. Drawn closer, you crouch beside them, instinctively reaching out to touch one of the blooms, letting the petal slide between your fingers with the utmost gentleness. The soft texture, so smooth against your skin, stirs something deep inside—a warmth and an excitement that echoes faintly from the memory you encountered in the maze.
The memory returns, vivid yet frustratingly incomplete. Whoever that person was, they must have loved lilies, as each petal feels like a fragment of them, filling you with the same joy you would have felt in their presence. You lean forward, bringing your face close to the bloom, closing your eyes as you take in its scent with a slow, deliberate breath. The fragrance surrounds you like an embrace, filling the air with a comfort you can not quite describe. For a moment, it feels as though someone is there with you, holding you close. Yet, as much as the memory fills you with warmth, there is an ache beneath it—a longing to know who this person was, and if they might be here, somewhere in this place.
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	As you linger in the moment, the crow flutters up beside you, watching with a slightly bemused look.
	Crow: “Admiring flowers now, are we?” it teases, though its tone holds a trace of genuine admiration. 
	Crow: “Funny, did not expect you to be one for such gentleness.”
	The crow shifts its weight slightly, ruffling its feathers as if trying to appear nonchalant. But there is something in its gaze—a flicker of longing, perhaps?—that makes you wonder if it is secretly seeking your attention, craving a gentle touch the way you have handled the flower.
	->Pet the crow.
		With a soft smile, you reach out to the crow, your fingers moving as carefully over its feathers as they did over the lily. As you touch its feathers, you feel the tiny movements of its breathing, the faint pulse of life beneath its warm body.

As you walk along the winding paths of the garden, your attention is drawn to an old toolbox lying beside the path, as though it was abandoned in a hurry. A few tools spill from its open lid, scattered in disarray across the ground. Yet, as you approach, it is not the spade or shears that draw your eye—it is a small, rough pencil peeking out from a side pocket. Its worn wood and splintered edges tug at something deep within, stirring the same strange familiarity you have had felt before in the maze. But this time, there is no rush of panic, only a soft, comforting sense of connection.
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	The crow swoops down beside you, eyeing the toolbox and then glancing at you with a mischievous glint.
	Crow: “What is this? Thinking of a career in gardening?” it chuckles, tilting its head. 
	Crow: “If you are going to take anything, might as well grab the whole box. You could practically start your own workshop.”
	You shoot it a sidelong glare, a quiet defiance bubbling up as you reach down and pluck the pencil alone, slipping it swiftly into your pocket. The crow raises an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard.
	Crow: “Just the pencil? Really? I was kidding, but…” it trails off, watching you turn away with a smirk, giving it the cold shoulder as you walk toward the greenhouse.
	Realizing it might have pushed you too far, the crow flutters after you, squawking in half-hearted protest.
	Crow: “Hey, do not be so touchy! It was just a joke! Come on, do not ignore me.” But you keep your pace, listening to its protests fade as you focus on the comfort that small pencil brings.

But as you look closer, it is clear this pencil does not carry the same weight—only a soft, steady feeling that calls to you, warm and familiar.
	After a moment of contemplation, you carefully pick up the pencil, sliding it into your pocket with a small sense of relief. It is a quiet comfort, grounding you as you straighten up and turn toward the greenhouse, ready to meet the crow and see what awaits inside.

As you stroll leisurely through the garden, you take in its beauty and meticulous design. Every hedge, every flowerbed, every path is almost perfectly symmetrical, clean and flawless. The closer you look, the more its precision strikes you. But then, an uneasy thought creeps in: 
You: “It was made to look perfect.”
The phrase repeats in your mind, and with it, an uncomfortable weight settles over you. That sensation, like a bittersweet taste, fills your heart and twists in your stomach. It is hauntingly familiar—the same feeling you had back in the maze, when you saw the broken picture frame with no photograph. That frame must have once looked whole and perfect too… but no longer. The memory gnaws at you, twisting the gardens beauty into something bitter and hollow.
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	Sensing your unease, the crow glides down from the air and lands lightly on your shoulder. Its presence steadies you, grounding you back to the moment. You let out a quiet breath, your heart easing with the crows silent companionship.
	You: “Thanks… for being here.” You speak softly, almost afraid the crow will brush it off, but it remains quiet, a steady warmth beside you.
	The feeling still lingers, but with the crow by your side, it is easier to shake off. You glance down the path leading to the greenhouse, a twisted resolve forming. As you head forward, the once-beautiful garden feels subtly warped, its pristine order unsettling rather than comforting.
<<elseif $CrowFollows is false>>
	The more you linger here, the heavier that uncomfortable feeling becomes. The symmetry of the garden now seems oppressive, like a place too determined to look untouched and pure. Your pulse quickens, and you find yourself glancing back down the path toward the greenhouse. Perhaps being around the crow will ease this unease, or at the very least, distract you from it. With a steadying breath, you turn and start back toward the greenhouse.

But before you make it far, something catches your eye. Lying in the middle of the path, where it had not been a moment ago, is a small wooden chest. It is simple and plain, with no lock or markings, almost like it materialized just for you.
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	The crow shifts on your shoulder, eyeing the chest warily before cocking its head with interest.
	Crow: “Now that is strange, is it not? A mysterious box, just lying here like it was waiting for you.” It caws softly, its gaze flicking between you and the chest, as if challenging you to open it.
	You hesitate, feeling a slight tremor of unease, but curiosity wins out. Kneeling down, you unlatch the lid and peer inside. Nestled in the bottom is a single, rusty key. Its handle bears the design of a tree—familiar somehow, but you can not place why.
	Crow: “A key?” it scoffs, feathers ruffling. 
	Crow: “Not the most thrilling treasure. But…” It narrows its eyes at the tree etched into the handle. 
	Crow:“Looks professionally made, does it not? Maybe the greenhouse has a keyhole just waiting for this. Trees and greenhouses—seems like a natural pairing, do you not think?” The crows voice carries a note of humor, but its eyes gleam with curiosity as it nudges you toward the greenhouse.

	You pause, the faint feeling that there’s more to this key nagging at you. Perhaps the crow might know something about it?Slipping the key into your pocket, you stand and make your way back toward the greenhouse, hoping to find it there waiting for you.

As you wander through the endless paths of the garden, you can not help but notice how perfectly serene everything feels. A soft, refreshing breeze flutters by, stirring the leaves and carrying the scent of flowers. The delicate symphony of rustling grass, distant birdsong, and swaying plants fills the air, creating a harmony so complete it almost feels unreal.
But as you take a second look around, a strange thought lingers. 
You: “Why is it so perfect here?” 
Every flowerbed is pruned and arranged with meticulous care, every path free from stray leaves or weeds. And yet… there is no one else here. No sign of gardeners, no tools, no stray footprints in the dirt. The garden seems almost untouched, as if it is waiting just for you. A flicker of unease twists within you. Why only these specific flowers? Why is everything so detailed, so flawless?
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	Suddenly, the crow swoops down, landing in front of you with an impatient caw.
	Crow: “Oh, come on now! Enough with the mystery and brooding. You are not going to find anything exciting out here.” It ruffles its feathers, cocking its head toward the greenhouse. 
	Crow: “We came here to explore, did we not? So let us get on with it.”
	A small smile tugs at the corner of your mouth. The crows impatience, its eagerness to press forward, feels almost… endearing. You sigh and give a nod, the nagging questions fading slightly in the face of the crows restless enthusiasm. Together, you turn back toward the greenhouse, anticipation building once more for what might lie within.

<<elseif $CrowFollows is false>>
	Just as you sink deeper into your thoughts, a chill prickles across your skin. The air feels heavier, almost thick, as if something unseen were watching you. That serene calmness suddenly takes on a sharper edge, a creeping sense of eyes upon you from somewhere unseen. It is as if the garden itself has noticed you noticing it.
	Without a second thought, you turn on your heel, quickening your pace toward the greenhouse. The questions can wait; right now, the only thought is to reach the safety of the crows presence.

As you step into the greenhouse, instantly, the air changes—a subtle, humid warmth wrapped in the faint scent of soil, old wood, and distant memories. The world outside seems to fall away as they take in the space before them.
<<if $CrowFollows is true>>
	The crow flits past you in a sudden, swift motion, barely rustling the air but leaving behind an odd warmth. The crow settles on one of the plant pots hanging from the ceiling, nudging its head against a cascade of greenery as if in a strange, almost affectionate embrace. As you watch the crow, something pulls at your heart, a feeling you can't quite name—a kinship that feels deeper than simple companionship. This connection feels… ancient, a bond laced with echoes of trust and understanding that words would only weaken.
	The crow, catches your gaze, giving a ruffled tilt of its head, one eye keenly fixed on you. 
	Crow:"What are you staring at?" it mocks with a dry, teasing tone, breaking the silence. Your face warms up, and they glance away, feeling strangely bare under the crows stare.

Near the norths entrance from where you entered, stands an old, weathered workbench which looms like a silent relic of days long gone. Scattered soil patches and a coating of dust cover its surface, disturbed only by faint traces left by hands long absent. A mirror lies face-up on the table, hazy with age and streaked with grime, reflecting only pale, fractured light from above. Next to it, a set of worn garden tools lies abandoned, their handles rough from years of use. A burned candle sits off-center, wax pooled and hardened, as if someone had forgotten it mid-thought. Sunlight filters down in thin, fragile beams, catching particles of dust that drift lazily through the air, turning the scene almost surreal—caught between worlds of memory and decay. The scent of burnt wax lingers faintly, mingling with the warm earthiness, creating an atmosphere heavy with nostalgia.
To the left of the workbench, you notice a wall lined with rows of hooks, each holding dried flower bundles bound with faded, colored twine. Scattered feathers lie in small clumps on the floor, remnants from visits past or perhaps quiet tokens from the crows unspoken memories. The shattered ceramic vase rests on a ledge beside you, fragments of its edges sharp yet carefully arranged, like a broken heart laid bare with careful reverence. There is a stillness here that feels almost sacred, as though this corner is an unspoken monument to memories that can no longer be touched but must not be forgotten. Your gaze lingers, feeling a sadness you can not quite explain, as if you are looking through a veil into lives you almost remember.
In the center of the greenhouse, you notice a small, separate glasshouse, its panes formed from an array of vibrant colors and adorned with beautiful, intricate shapes and symbols that remain incomprehensible. This little structure stands as a stark contrast to the surrounding greenery, appearing both magical and forlorn. Overgrown by wild plants that seem to have taken hold with an unyielding grip, it looks fairly old compared to the rest of the greenhouse. Vines twist around its edges, and the soil beneath is thick with roots and small blooms, creating an air of forgotten wonder. The glass glimmers, capturing the light and refracting it into a kaleidoscope of colors, each hue shifting and dancing as the breeze stirs the leaves around it. Yet despite its beauty, there is a sense of abandonment—a whisper of stories untold and memories that might never be uncovered.
Moving to the back corner, your eyes catch on a hanging pot with a dried ivy plant. Its withered vines drape down in long, fragile lines, reaching out as if grasping for something just beyond reach. Beneath it sits a small side table with a locked seed box bearing a delicate tree symbol carved onto its surface. A small shiver runs down your spine; this corner feels nearly suffocating, like a memory left to rot, locked away and forgotten for far too long. The air here is cooler, thick with a sense of neglect and abandonment.
Directly across from this corner, you find a wooden shelf lined with glass jars of various soils. Each jar has a label scrawled in handwriting so faint and spidery that it is barely legible. Nestled beside them sits a glass dome housing a wilting rose, its once-vibrant petals turned dark and brittle, tinged with shadows of red that look almost bruised in the dim, filtered light. The dome is fogged, as though this rose breathes with a faint, haunted life of its own. There is an odd tranquility in this area, a frozen peace, as if time itself has ceased to touch these things.
You step back, taking in each detail, each carefully arranged fragment, and feel an odd pang. This greenhouse is not merely a place; it is a testament to something—maybe something forgotten, or something you were meant to find.
When you glance back up, you notice the crow, seemingly asleep. Its eyes are closed, feathers smoothed down, its head tucked close as it nestles against the hanging plant. A gentle, rhythmic movement of its chest suggests a rare tranquility, and you feel a soft smile tug at your lips. The sight is unexpected, a rare glimpse at a side of the crow you would never consider. You feel a strange warmth in your chest, the kind one feels in the quiet presence of something precious and unguarded.
Not wanting to disturb the crows peace, you move silently, letting your fingers graze the tables and plants around you. Alone in this strange, silent world, you realize that, for the first time in a long while, you feel a sliver of calm and a quiet yearning to uncover what lies beyond the edges of this greenhouse—something just as delicate, just as deeply rooted, as the memories that live here.

As you approach, the workbench comes into clearer view, its surface littered with remnants of the past—scattered soil patches, a fine layer of dust, and the lingering scent of smoke that wafts up to greet you. Small beams of sunlight filter down, catching particles of dust floating lazily in the air, casting a surreal glow over the scene. It feels almost dreamlike, a snapshot of a world left behind.
You run your fingers lightly across the weathered surface of the table, feeling the uneven texture beneath your touch. Dust clings to your fingertips as you lean in closer, and your gaze is drawn to some of the things laying around the workbench that seem to beckon for your attention.
First, your eyes land on a dusty old mirror lying face-up. Its surface is hazy and clouded with age, reflecting back a distorted version of yourself. You feel a slight shiver run down your spine, as if the mirror might reveal more than just your image—perhaps a glimpse into moments long past, fragments of a forgotten story that linger just out of reach.
Across the workbench and the floor around it are old garden tools scattered around, from the looks of it they must be a set. Some of the gardenshovels lay clattered on a pile, the handles rough and worn from years of use. The metal shows signs of rust, but it still glimmers dully in the light. You can almost imagine the hands that once wielded these tools, feeling the weight of each one as they tended to the very plants that surround you. They feel imbued with history, like echoes of a time when life thrived in this very space.
Your attention shifts to a burned candle resting off-center, the wax pooled and hardened into peculiar shapes. The wick is long extinguished, but you can still detect a faint scent of smoke lingering in the air. Its placement suggests a moment interrupted—perhaps someone left it behind in haste, their thoughts still clinging to the flickering flame. You can not help but wonder what secrets it might hold, what quiet reflections it witnessed in the stillness of this greenhouse.
Each object feels like a thread woven into the fabric of this place, whispering stories of love, loss, and lingering regrets. You feel a sense of curiosity swell within you, pulling you toward one of these items, eager to uncover the hidden tales they might share.

You take a moment, examining the delicate imperfections in the mirror, the way the light refracts and bends. In its depths, you see not just your reflection, but fragments of your own struggles, your fears, and your aspirations.

You step into the corner, a secluded enclave tucked away at the back of the greenhouse. The air here feels heavier, thick with an almost palpable sense of history. Above you, the hanging pot cradles a withered ivy plant, its fragile vines swaying gently, almost as if they are reaching for something just out of grasp. Each tendril seems to dance softly in the still air, casting long, wavering shadows against the cool, damp walls. The faintest rustling sound accompanies their movement, like whispers exchanged between long-forgotten friends.
As you take in the sight, the corners of this shadowy alcove unfold before you, revealing a small side table that looks as if it hasn’t been disturbed in years. It holds a box, its surface adorned with a delicate carving of a tree, an intricate detail that draws your eye. The box sits in quiet defiance of time, waiting patiently for a hand to unlock its secrets.
The atmosphere here is steeped in mystery; the dim light filtering through the greenhouse glass casts a muted glow over the scene, highlighting the contours of the ivy and the rich wood of the table. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet fragrance of decay, creating an ambience that feels both reverent and sorrowful.
The ivys dry leaves rustle softly, and you can not shake the feeling that you are not just observing but are part of a much larger narrative—a story woven from threads of loss, memory, and untapped potential. Here, the past lingers like a ghost, inviting you to delve deeper into the intertwined fates of the ivy and the seed box, both heavy with unspoken tales waiting to be unearthed.

The ivy, in its decay, becomes a symbol of clinging—of holding onto traumas and experiences that may no longer serve you, yet remain tightly entwined with your being.
	As you ponder the stories woven into the plants fibers, you can almost feel the echoes of past emotions reverberating within its drooping form. It seems to beckon you to confront those hidden feelings, to acknowledge the shadows that linger just out of reach.

This box is more than a mere container; it represents the hidden potential within you—seeds of possibility waiting for the right moment to sprout. The weight of the box feels heavier now, a tangible reminder of the dreams and aspirations that lie dormant, waiting for release.
	You shake the box gently, feeling the weight of the seeds inside, and a thrill courses through you. What might they become if only they were given the chance to grow? The locked nature of the box resonates with you on a deeper level, symbolizing the parts of yourself you may have tucked away, the aspirations you have hidden from view. In this moment, you recognize that growth often requires courage—courage to unlock those hidden parts and allow them to flourish.

		Your gaze lingers on the intricate carving of the tree symbol, its winding branches and roots seeming to pulse with potential. You trace the design with your finger, feeling a connection stir within you—a resonance that is almost tangible. It is then that a fleeting memory flashes through your mind, pulling you back to the fog maze you had traversed earlier.
		You recall the oppressive silence and the sense of being watched, a chill running down your spine at the thought of those shadows that danced just beyond your vision. The encounter had left a knot of unease in your stomach, a lingering feeling of vulnerability that you had not quite shaken off. The memory of the key you had found there surfaces, and you can almost feel its cold weight resting in your pocket.
		Could it be? You take a moment to reflect, your heart quickening as you align the details in your mind. The key had been shaped like a tree, its handle reminiscent of the very symbol before you now. The realization dawns on you: it is possible that this key, born from that unnerving maze, might indeed fit the lock on the box.
		With a deep breath, you reach into your pocket and retrieve the key, its presence feeling more significant now, almost like a talisman for the hidden potential you hope to unlock. You examine it closely, the faint gleam of metal catching the light, and your determination solidifies. The connection feels undeniable. You approach the box once more, ready to test your theory, feeling a surge of hope alongside the shadows of doubt that linger from your previous encounter.

You blink in disbelief, your brow furrowing at the simplicity of them. They look almost like the kind you would find in any garden, round, and somewhat mundane. A wave of disappointment washes over you; you had anticipated something more mystical, perhaps a hint of magic woven into their very essence. Instead, you are met with the humdrum reality of what lies before you.
		You reach in, your fingers brushing against the seeds, feeling the coolness of their surfaces. They are nothing special, just seeds—average and ordinary. For a fleeting moment, you wonder if this is all there is, a reminder that not everything in this world is steeped in grandeur or mystery. The box had hinted at the potential for something great, but now it feels like an echo of lost hopes.
		Yet, as you study them more closely, you begin to consider the implications. While they may appear ordinary, each seed holds the promise of life—a potential that could bloom into something extraordinary if nurtured properly. They could grow into plants that bring beauty or sustenance, or perhaps even something unique to you alone.
		You glance around the shadowy corner of the greenhouse, taking in the withered ivy and the stillness surrounding you. The choice lies before you: take the seeds, embrace the possibility they offer, and perhaps embark on a new journey of growth. Or leave them, returning to the safety of the known, leaving behind the whispers of what could be.

The section of the greenhouse wall is adorned with rows of hooks, each holding a bundle of dried flowers, their once-vibrant hues now muted but still poignant. The flowers sway ever so slightly in the gentle currents of air, tied together with faded, colored twine, their fragility echoing the delicate nature of memory itself.
You take a moment to run your fingers along the smooth surface of the wall, feeling the coolness of the greenhouse glass behind you. Each flower seems to whisper its own tale, a cacophony of voices from the past swirling in the stillness. Scattered feathers lie in the corners, their soft edges ruffled, as if they’ve drifted in from somewhere else, perhaps carried by the crow you had seen earlier. And then your gaze is drawn to the shattered ceramic vase perched on a small ledge nearby, a collection of broken pieces arranged almost reverently, as if to honor what once was.
The air here is heavy with emotion, a palpable sense of nostalgia that clings to you, urging you to delve deeper into this corner of the greenhouse and uncover its hidden secrets. You feel compelled to interact with the objects around you, drawn to the stories they might hold.

As you step closer, your eyes are immediately drawn to the wooden structure lined with small glass jars, each one filled with different types of soil. The jars seem to whisper secrets of their origins, though the faint labels are written in almost unintelligible handwriting, a language lost to time. You can not help but wonder what stories lie beneath their earthy surfaces.
Beside the jars, a glass dome houses a wilting rose, its dark and brittle petals barely holding onto their former glory. The dome fogs slightly with the warmth of the air, as if preserving the delicate flower within. The atmosphere is oddly serene yet tinged with an eerie sense of suspended time, where the dusty beams of light catch the glass jars, creating reflections that dance like fragmented memories.
You feel a pull to interact with this collection, to touch the jars and the rose, to uncover the stories they guard.

	You find yourself drawn deeper into contemplation as you examine the wilting rose encased in its fragile glass dome. It is more than just a flower; it embodies the essence of fragility and decay, a silent testament to the transient nature of beauty and existence. The delicate petals, once vibrant and full of life, now hang limp and brittle, their rich colors fading into muted shadows. It strikes you how similar this rose is to the memories you hold close—the cherished moments that, while preserved in your mind, gradually lose their luster with the passage of time.
	As you lean closer, the soft scent of aged petals wafts through the air, a bittersweet aroma that clings to the edges of your thoughts. You reflect on your own experiences, each one a petal in the bouquet of your life, each with its own story of joy, sorrow, or perhaps a blend of both. Memories, much like this rose, can be preserved in the glass dome of your mind, yet they too are subject to the ravages of time. You think of laughter shared, of love that once felt infinite, now dulled by the weight of years. The realization settles heavily in your chest—a poignant reminder that even the most cherished moments can succumb to fading.
	You withdraw your hand slowly, an ache of understanding blossoming within you. The wilting rose stands as a beautiful testament to the cycles of life, inviting you to embrace both the beauty and the decay that accompany your own journey. It whispers a truth you can no longer ignore: that within the fragility of existence lies a deeper resilience. Life, with all its fleeting moments, is not merely about preservation; it is about acceptance, growth, and the inevitability of change.
	As you step back, the glass dome refracts the light around you, casting delicate shadows on the shelf, each movement a gentle reminder that decay is not the end but a part of a greater cycle. You find a strange comfort in this realization, a quiet strength in knowing that even as memories fade, their essence remains, intertwined with who you are and who you are becoming.

As you follow the faint voice that calls to you, anticipation swells within your chest. Each step draws you closer to the small, separate glasshouse, a whimsical structure that stands apart from the sprawling greenery of the surrounding greenhouse. Its panes, a mosaic of vibrant colors, glimmer in the light, casting enchanting patterns on the ground as they refract sunlight into a kaleidoscope of hues. Intricate shapes and symbols adorn the glass, each curve and twist speaking of magic and mystery, yet remaining stubbornly incomprehensible. The contrast between this little sanctuary and the lush plants outside is stark; it feels like a portal to another realm—one both beautiful and forlorn.
Vines snake around the edges of the glasshouse, their tendrils encroaching like fingers trying to reclaim a forgotten treasure. The soil beneath is thick with roots, their wrinkled fingers clutching at the earth, mingling with delicate blooms that dare to grow in this enclosed space. As you step inside, the air shifts around you, filled with an earthy scent that is at once comforting and unsettling, a reminder of life teetering on the edge of neglect.
It is then that you notice the flower, pulsating softly in the center of the glasshouse. Its shape is strange—long, wrinkly petals unfurl like a delicate, almost alien creature, glowing with a heartbeat-like rhythm. The glow is a soft white-beige, almost ethereal, illuminating the surrounding space with a gentle light. Deep green leaves cradle the stem, sturdy yet graceful, anchoring the flower firmly into the floor, unlike the other plants that thrive in pots or beds in the greenhouse beyond. This one feels like a part of the very foundation of this space, a singularity amid the chaos of life outside.
The interior of the glasshouse feels like a sanctuary of stillness compared to the vibrancy of the greenhouse outside. Here, the absence of other plants amplifies the flower's presence, drawing your focus entirely to it. While the greenhouse bursts with life, the glasshouse is an oasis of isolation, the only life creeping through the gaps between the panes or taking root in the soil below.

	As you stand in this small, enchanting world, the contrast strikes you—where the greenhouse is a chaotic celebration of nature, the glasshouse feels like a sacred space, caught in a moment of suspended time.

In this moment, you feel the weight of its existence, as if it has been waiting for you all along, calling out across the boundaries of memory and time.

Your steps echo slightly on the marble-like surface. The crow still flying above you, casts the only seeable shadow in this place and occasionally glides across the ground like a fleeting thought.
Crow: "Ah, so you are just going to walk, huh? Not even going to ask? Bold move."
You keep moving, unsure of where you are going but knowing that standing still is it not an option anymore. The fog grows thicker as you press forward. Somewhere, deep down, you hope this endless walking will lead to something—anything.
Crow: "You always were the quiet type. But do not think you can ignore me forever. I am all you have got here."
You try to block out its voice, but it is always there, lingering like the fog. You do not know what is worse—this endless place, or the fact that you might never leave it.
Letting the unkown fade behind you, the ground beneath your feet begins to feel uneven and shifts slightly almost not noticable, as if it responds to your movement.
The crow flutters alongside you, its wings making soft whispers in the still air. For a moment, you both walk in silence, the weight of your thoughts hanging between you like a thin veil. The crow occasionally tosses a snarky remark about the surroundings, but you mostly keep to yourself, focusing on the path ahead.
Suddenly, the crow begins to hum a melody—a haunting tune that feels oddly familiar, echoing through your mind like a long-forgotten lullaby. You turn your head up to the crow, curious.
Your thoughts swirl, momentarily lost in the rhythm of the melody. Why a crow? You ponder. Does it hold a deeper meaning? Are you meant to decipher something from this strange companionship?
As you contemplate these questions, a glimmer catches your eye in the distance. You squint against the fog and see a building—a structure rising like a mirage. It appears to be part castle, part cathedral, its white facade almost blending into the surrounding mist.
Crow: “Look!” the crow suddenly exclaims, its voice cutting through your reverie. 
Crow: “You noticed it before I did!” it lets out a surprised caw. 
You glance at the crow, catching a hint of disappointment in its beady eyes.
Crow: “Guess I am just a bit slow today!” and quickly brushes it dissapointment off with a lighthearted chuckle.
As you both draw nearer to the building, its true scale begins to reveal itself. Towering spires reach into the fog, blending into the sky, while intricate bridges connect various parts of the structure, creating a network that seems to defy logic. Some pathways lead to nowhere, abruptly ending in mid-air, while others curve away, as if inviting exploration into the unknown.
You stand in awe at the sight, a mix of wonder and trepidation swelling in your chest. The building is an amalgamation of different styles, with soaring arches and narrow windows, as if it were pieced together.
Finally, you stop in front of the first tower, its stone cold and smooth against your fingertips. The crow lands nearby, its head cocked as it studies the structure. 
Crow:“What do you think? Should we go in, or do you prefer to stand out here and admire the view?”
->Go in.

	You take a step back, feeling a cold shiver run down your spine. The closer you get to the massive structure, the more its sheer size overwhelms you. It towers above, a monolith of twisting, intertwining towers and bridges, each more intricate and foreboding than the last. The blank, white walls seem to stretch infinitely into the sky, blending with the fog. For a moment, you swear its shadow is creeping toward you, ready to swallow you whole if you look away for even a second.
	Your heart races, and a sense of unease gnaws at your gut. You take another step back, feeling the overwhelming weight of the structure pressing down on you, suffocating in its presence. You stop moving, staring at it like prey caught in the gaze of a predator.
	Crow: “What is this? The big, bad castle is too much for you?” The crow flaps down to land beside you, its voice dripping with sarcasm.
	Crow: “If you sre gonna stand there gawking all day, we might as well keep walking. Unless you sre afraid it will eat you alive.” It hops closer, mockingly craning its neck to stare up at the towers.
	Crow: “It does look a bit hungry, does it not?”
	You blink, shaken from your daze, but the unease remains. You glance at the crow, whose beady eyes twinkle with amusement, as if it is more entertained by your fear than concerned.
	Crow: “So, what is the plan? Gonna brave the belly of the beast or keep running with your tail between your legs?”
	You feel your pulse slow a little, the crows teasing breaking the tension. You let out a slow breath, forcing yourself to look away from the looming structure. The fear lingers, but something inside urges you forward. Still, you hesitate. Something about this place feels too off, too dangerous to step into unprepared.
	The crow flutters onto your shoulder, nudging you with its wing.
	Crow: “Come on now, you are not scared of a few bricks and stones, are you?” It cocks its head.
	Crow: “Or are you?”
	You grunt in frustration but can not help feeling a bit embarrassed. Maybe the crows right—maybe you are just overthinking it. Still, there is something about this castle that feels… wrong. Like once you step inside, there is no turning back.
	Crow: “Suit yourself.” It stretches its wings lazily.
	Crow: “We can keep walking if you are not ready to face your fears.” The crows tone is light, almost mocking, but beneath it, there is a subtle challenge.
	Crow: “Plenty more out there to explore. Or we can stay here and stare at this thing till your eyes pop out”
	You let the crows words sink in, the weight of the decision pressing on your mind. You follow the feeling in your gut and turn away from the grand and towering structure and begin walking in a different direction.
	Crow: "So be it, intresting choice little one" the crow says as it takes of to fly in front of you.
	An uneasy feeling flickers inside you as you walk further and further away from the structure, feeling as if you had eyes on you. Watching you from the behind.
	<<if $AmountBravery >=1>>
	    You gather your courage and turn around to see-nothing. There is just the fading shadows of the structure you left behind. You can still make out its blurry shape of the tower you stood in front of. A moment passes as you look at it and the feeling of eeriness vanishes too.
	    With that you turn around and keep going on your way not noticing the crows expression of surprise.

->Investigate before going in. <<if $AmountInvestigation >=1>>
	    Curiosity tugs at your mind, and instead of stepping through the entrance immediately, you pause. The building demands closer scrutiny. You decide to take a moment and examine it from where you stand.
	    At first glance, the structure seems almost too perfect, its stark white surface blending into the mist, giving it an ethereal quality. But as you focus, details begin to emerge—details that twist your perception of the buildings beauty.
	    The towers, stretching high into the fog, form a complex network of cylindrical shapes, with some leaning at odd angles, as if they were stacked precariously upon one another. The walkways, which seem endless, crisscross through the space like a labyrinth. Multiple paths overlap, creating a dizzying layout that suggests one wrong step could send you spiraling back to where you started.
	    Your eyes follow the intricate bridges connecting the towers. They wind like serpents, climbing and descending across varying heights with no clear direction. You note how few of them have railings—just bare edges that plummet into an unknown depth below. The lack of safety adds a foreboding layer to the structure, as if one misstep could mean the end.
	    You take some steps around the tower in front of you, eyeing the Gothic architecture more closely. It is elaborate, almost obsessively detailed. Arched windows are framed by stone carvings of strange, twisted creatures—gargoyles or something far more surreal. The walls are adorned with intricate patterns, spirals, and symbols that seem to shift as you study them, adding an unsettling charm to the already imposing towers. The juxtaposition of fancy embellishments against the cold, white texture creates a strange sense of balance, as if beauty and danger coexist in harmony here.
	    The minimal lighting around the structure does not help ease the tension. Some areas are bathed in light, illuminating the architecture with an almost heavenly glow, while others sink into shadow, where details fade and mystery prevails.
	    You notice the lack of color—everything is pure white, almost bland, save for the shadows that cut through the towers and walkways. It creates a feeling of sterility, as if life itself has been stripped from the place. Yet, it is beautiful in its simplicity.
	    At the edges of the walkways, there are occasional drops that lead into nothingness, just voids that disappear into the mist. You catch a glimpse of ladders, spiraling downward to unseen floors, connecting what must be several different levels. Each floor seems to sprawl out in random directions, some paths leading nowhere, others doubling back on themselves.
	    The structure feels alive in its complexity, designed to confuse and disorient anyone. You can already imagine the frustration of navigating it, the constant backtracking, the endless circling around. Yet, despite that, it holds a strange allure—a promise that, hidden within the maze, something valuable might be found.

	    Crow: “What is the verdict?” it asks with a smirk. 
	    Crow: “Looks like a nightmare to walk through, huh?”
	    You nod, still contemplating the bizarre mix of elegance and confusion that makes up the building. There is something deeply unsettling about it, but you can't help but feel drawn to it as well.

You step forward, crossing the threshold of the massive, arching opening of the tower. The inside is just as unnerving as the outside—strangely lit, though there is no visible source of light. It is the same eerie white as the exterior, and yet it feels different. The sensation of the walls pressing down on you is much stronger here, an oppressive weight that sinks deeper into your chest with every passing second. It is as though the structure itself is watching you, waiting.
Crow: “This place sees everything, you know.” The crows voice cuts through the silence, strange and unsettling. It hops along beside you, its sharp eyes darting to the walls. 
Crow: “Might as well keep walking. Not much else to do in a place like this.”
You glance at the crow, uneasy. Its tone holds an edge of something… off. There is a pause, long enough to make your heart race faster.
Crow:“Not that there is any way out now, anyway.” it adds with an amused laugh.
Your blood runs cold. Instinctively, you spin around, but the door you just stepped through—it's gone. Vanished. The smooth, seamless wall stares back at you as though the opening had never existed.
Panic starts to rise in your chest, your breath quickening as your thoughts swirl. The walls seem to close in, the structure tightening its grip. Your mind is louder, thoughts racing faster and more frantic with each passing second.
<<if $CrowsFavour >=1>>
	The crow, noticing the shift in your demeanor, swoops down and lands gently on your shoulder. Its presence is oddly grounding, and it turns its head toward you, watching your face closely, almost... thoughtfully. It is strange, but for the first time, the crow seems genuinely concerned.
	Crow: “Hey, easy now,” it says in a softer tone, something almost reassuring in its voice. 
	Crow: “You are alright. No need to let this place get to you.”
	You blink, startled by the tenderness in the crows words, but somehow, it works. The panic in your chest loosens, and the frantic voices in your mind quiet down. The oppressive weight of the tower lifts just a little, as though the crows presence is helping keep it at bay.
	Crow: “Besides,” it adds with a playful lilt.
	Crow:“I think I will enjoy this new arrangement. Me, the king, riding on your shoulder while you march through this creepy castle.” It caws with amusement, nudging your cheek as if to lighten the mood.
	You can not help but crack a small smile, the tension easing as the crow's humor cuts through your fear. You straighten up, taking a deep breath, and continue forward. The walls no longer feel so suffocating, and the space between your thoughts opens up, calm returning.
	<<set $AmountHope = $AmountHope +1>>
<<else>>
	The crow does not seem to notice—or maybe it does not care. It takes off suddenly, flapping its wings with a burst of energy, flying ahead and out the next doorway.
	Crow: “Come on, stop overthinking everything! You have got legs—use them!” Its voice, snarky as ever, echoes back at you from somewhere ahead.
	You swallow hard, your mind still buzzing with the weight of panic, but the crows words are enough to pull you out of your spiraling thoughts. You steel yourself, focusing on the path in front of you and pushing aside the gnawing anxiety. Without another glance at the vanished doorway, you follow the crow.
<<endif>>
You emerge from the tower onto one of the many bridges. It stretches out before you, narrow and winding, connecting this tower to mayn other bridges that lead to different towers in the sprawling maze of white. The bridge being made out of the same weird material as the tower is also marked by distinct carvings and patterns of  uncomprehendable symbols and what seems to be figures or creatures of some sort. A cold gust of wind whips past you.
<<if $AmountPerception >=1>>
	It almost blows you over but you can collect your strength and hold against it till its gone.
	<<set $AmountStrength = $AmountStrength +1>>
<<else>>
	The wind is so strong that it makes you tumble and hold onto the low railing of the bridge till its gone past you.
<<endif>>
You wonder why theres such a strong wind on this bridge or even this place and realize that below you awaits an endless abyss, an unsettling reminder of how far you could fall. How come you could not see this abyss lurking under the structure before you went inside? 
The crow perches on the railing, looking back at you with a glint of something between curiosity and mischief.
Crow: “You wanted an adventure, did you not?” it cackles, before hopping forward to lead the way across the bridge.
You take a deep breath, steadying yourself. There is no going back now. The only way is forward.
As both of you continue across the narrow, winding bridge, you look around, taking in the vastness of the structure. From this vantage point, the sheer scale of it becomes clear. Endless paths curl around towers scattered in every direction, some leading to places that seem unreachable, while others stop abruptly in midair, vanishing into the white void. The architecture is grand and imposing, yet somehow disorienting—a labyrinth that defies logic.
Your gaze drifts downward to the abyss below, being the only contrast in this place to the so everbeing white enviroment. A chill runs down your spine. It is impossible to see what is at the bottom, if there even is one. Is it just an endless fall? Is there something down there waiting, or is it like the void you came from?
Before your mind can spiral further into these thoughts, the crows voice cuts through your reverie.
Crow: “There is nothing down there, and you really should not even think about it,” it quips, hopping along the railing beside you.
Crow:“All those deep thoughts are going to pile up and—pop! Just like a balloon!” It mimics the sound of something exploding with a mischievous caw, its beady eyes glinting with amusement.
You stop in your tracks, surprised by how the crow seemed to read your thoughts so effortlessly. Your reaction does not go unnoticed.
Crow: “Aw, look at you, actually listening for once. I am touched!” Its voice drips with sarcasm, as it flutters down to walk beside you, clearly pleased with itself.
You roll your eyes and mutter, “Ugh, whatever.” You are not in the mood for its mockery, but something about its presence, even in these unnerving moments, is oddly grounding.
Soon, the bridge reaches an intersection where the path splits into three separate walkways, each leading in a different direction. The pathways are identical in appearance, curving out of sight as they wrap around different towers. The crow flys onto the railing and lands beside you, head tilted, as if waiting for your decision.
Crow: “Well, looks like it is decision time again,” it says with a playful edge. 
Crow: “So, which way are we wandering off to now?”
<<if $AmountPerception >=1>>
	You pause, taking in each path more carefully.
	The first thing you notice is the path to the right that seems to lead towards a tall and wide tower. It stands out from the others, not only because of its height and width but also its distinct design or the absence of it. Unlike the other structures that are dotted with windows and archways, smybols and carvings, this one appears completely blanc and sealed—no windows are visible from your vantage point, and it almost feels... silent. An unsettling feeling creeps into your mind, though you can't help but wonder if there are windows on the other side, hidden from view.
	The path to the left, on the other hand, looks like a tangled mess. It leads into a maze of bridges and smaller towers, their winding and crisscrossing paths making your head spin just from looking at them. The whole layout seems like a disaster waiting to happen.
	Crow: “Whew, that one is going to be a real headache. Good luck not getting lost in that rats nest,” the crow jokes, flapping its wings as if just thinking about it tires them.
	Finally, your gaze falls on the last path straight ahead of you. It appears to lead through more bridges and towers, but something in the distance catches your attention. There, at the far end, is a pile of towers, merged together like a cluster of old buildings. And in the middle, one particular structure becomes visible—a cathedral, or at least something that looks like one. The sharp spires and pointed arches feel oddly familiar, tugging at something in your memory. You can not place it, but it is like you have seen this cathedral before, somewhere long ago.
	Crow: “Ah, a cathedral, is it? I am not one for religion myself, but hey, why do not we pop in and pray for some answers?” The sarcasm in the crows voice is thick, but it does not completely hide the intrigue beneath.
	You remain still for a moment, staring ahead at the paths before you. Each one holds its own mystery, its own uncertainty. You need to choose.
<<else>>
	You take a deep breath, looking at the paths ahead, unsure of where any of them will lead.

	For a moment, you hesitate, and then you glance over at the crow, hoping for some guidance.
	You: "What do you think? Which way should we go?"
	The crow tilts its head, considering you for a moment before letting out a soft caw.
	Crow: "Ah, advice, is it? Well, if I were you, I’d follow your gut—it's never wrong. Right?" The crow pauses for dramatic effect, clearly enjoying watching you stew in the uncertainty.
	A long silence stretches out between you, making the indecision feel heavier by the second. Then, the crow breaks it with a snarky comment.
	Crow: “But if you really need me to spell it out, the way ahead seems logical. Worst case, if you get lost or something weird happens—" it waves a wing dismissively— "just turn around and come back. Assuming, of course, the path does not disappear again.” The crows voice drips with sarcasm, as if it is rolling its eyes.
    You let out a breath, feeling a little more confident, though the crow's last remark still lingers uneasily in your mind.

The right path draws your attention almost immediately, leading directly to a massive tower that looms over everything else. It stands apart, not just because of its imposing height and sheer width, but also because of its stark simplicity. Where other structures around you are adorned with arched windows, intricate carvings, and scattered symbols that suggest some story or purpose, this one is blank—its walls smooth and unbroken. Not a single window pierces its surface, nor any symbol or relief to give a hint of what lies within. It almost feels… silent, as though the tower itself were holding its breath.
The crow, perched beside you, tilts its head and squawks out a wry comment about your choice, something snarky that might normally annoy you. But this time, it just feels like a faint echo against the tower’s looming presence. The bird takes off ahead, its dark form flickering against the pale walls of the tower as it flies toward the path’s end. You follow, glancing at the other paths veering off in the distance. They wind around shadowed buildings and twist over vast gaps, disappearing into the thick mist that veils everything beyond the platform. Below, an abyss stretches endlessly, a pit so deep that the darkness at its bottom seems almost alive. The thought sends a chill down your spine, and you refocus on the tower rising ahead of you.
Finally, you reach the entrance: a small, plain door, barely noticeable against the vastness of the tower. Its wood is painted a flat, pale white, smooth and unblemished, but there is something off about it—there is no handle. The crow lands nearby, letting out a mocking caw. 
Crow: “Well, that is one way to keep guests out! What are you going to do now? Knock?” it teases, eyeing the handle-less door.
Ignoring its mockery, you step forward and place your hand on the door, giving it a casual push. To your surprise, it swings inward with ease. For a moment, the crow stares, momentarily speechless, before clearing its throat. 
Crow: “Fine, fine. Guess you do not need me for everything,” it mutters, sounding almost embarrassed. With a flutter of wings, it takes off into the towers shadows. 
Crow: “I will wait for you at the top,” it calls back, its tone tinged with irritation.
You pause for a heartbeat, looking into the darkness that now lies before you. There is nothing else to do but step forward. As you cross the threshold, the door closes silently behind you, sealing off the faint light from outside. Darkness envelops you, thick and impenetrable. It is so absolute that even reaching out your hands yields nothing—no wall, no door, only an eerie silence.

The air feels thick and strangely damp, pressing in from all sides, and a dull ache builds in your chest as panic slowly takes hold. You stretch your hands out, brushing against nothing, desperate to find something—anything—that can serve as an anchor in this void.
Just when the silence seems to reach an unbearable peak, a faint, low voice emerges to your right. It is calling you, soft yet insistent, drawing you forward. But before you can even turn toward it, another voice begins calling out from the left, pleading with equal fervor for you to follow. You hesitate, torn between them, each one urging you in its direction. As if sensing your uncertainty, more voices begin to stir. They spring up from every corner of the darkness, like a cacophony of memories clawing their way out of the shadows.
The voices grow louder, layering over one another in distorted echoes that warp and twist around you, sabotaging one another in a chaotic swirl of sound. Your pulse quickens as the air begins to shift, catching you off guard as faint gusts press against your back and shoulders, as if urging you to step forward… or maybe backward. The pressure is suffocating, and every whisper feels like a finger poking at your most vulnerable thoughts, amplifying fears you thought were buried.
Taking a breath, you gather yourself and begin to move. The voices tug at you from all sides, some sound clearer, almost familiar, as if they are drawn from moments that still linger in your memory.

As you finally emerge from the suffocating darkness of the tower, the chill of the air brushes against your skin, a stark contrast to the oppressive silence you left behind. You find yourself on a broad, stone platform at the tower's pinnacle, the vast expanse of the abyss stretching out before you, deep and foreboding. The peering light that emits from of the plane of illusion blinding you momentarily, as you try and gather your senses back.
Perched on the railing, the crow greets you with a glint of mischief in its eyes, a sharp contrast to the anxiety that had clouded your mind moments before. 
Crow: "Well, look who finally decided to join the land of the living!" it caws, its voice light and teasing. 
Crow: “I would offer to help you up, but, you know, no hands. Just wings.”
You manage a faint smile, the absurdity of the moment breaking through the lingering fog in your mind. Gathering what strength you have left, you pull yourself upright, the effort igniting a spark of determination within you. The crow hops closer, its feathers glinting in the light, and you find your gaze drifting beyond it, drawn to a peculiar sight in the sky.
Floating in the white sky behind the crow is a faint, shimmering ball of yellow light, pulsating gently like a heartbeat. You can't tear your eyes away, a mixture of wonder and trepidation washing over you.
Crow: "Have you lost your mind or something?” the crow chimes, its tone half-serious, half-joking. 
You don't respond; instead, you find yourself pointing a finger at the ball of light, your heart racing with a blend of fear and curiosity.
The crow glances back, and its reaction is immediate and exaggerated. It shrieks, feathers puffing out like a startled cat, some even fluttering to the ground as it jumps up in a flurry of panic. 
Crow: “What is that?!” it squawks, darting behind you as if seeking refuge.
You turn, half-expecting danger, but the crows fright only adds to your confusion. 
Crow: “What is that thing? Be careful!” it warns, peering out from its hiding spot, eyes wide with a mix of concern and astonishment.
You are still grappling with your own disorientation, the shimmering orb hovering there, mesmerizing in its presence. It inches closer, slowly settling to rest atop the railing as if it has a mind of its own. The pulsating glow draws you in, urging you to approach.
Suddenly, a faint voice drifts through the air, soft and almost ethereal, barely audible against the backdrop of the night. It feels disembodied, floating on the air, and for a moment, fear grips you again. Could it be one of those voices from the tower?
Instinctively, you jump to your feet, heart racing, and the crow squawks again, startled by your sudden movement. You instinctively adopt a defensive stance, ready for anything. But nothing happens—just the gentle pulse of the light and that whispering voice, urging you to listen.
You take a cautious step forward, your heart pounding, eyes locked on the shimmering orb. As you lean in closer, the voice becomes clearer, each syllable like a thread weaving through the air, beckoning you to understand. You focus, straining to make out the words..
